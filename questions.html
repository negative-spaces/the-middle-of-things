                        David Hugill calls on geographers to "renovate and extend their interpretations of the 'urban' implications of colonial practice" (2017, 2). Yet, in thinking with what I've learned this term, I'm inclined to refigure his question in order to ask: What are the colonial implications of my urban practices, specifically alleyway gleaning? My contention is that the colonial implications of settler urban practices may be a significant object/site of inquiry, especially when those practices are assumed to be counter-hegemonic. What does it mean to situate alleyway gleaning as an alternate or marginal form of circulation, one happening alongside the disposal of waste which constitutes capitalist market value, when alleys are denaturalized and politicized? What does it mean to participate in noncapitalist forms of circulation such as scavenging and gleaning when the giving and taking of these excesses or surpluses is facilitated by an infrastructure that maintains ongoing urbanization of a settler-colonial city?
