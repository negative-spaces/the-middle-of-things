                        David Hugill calls on geographers to "renovate and extend their interpretations of the 'urban' implications of colonial practice" (2017, 2). Yet, in thinking with what I've learned this term, I'm inclined to refigure his question in order to ask: What are the colonial implications of my urban practices, specifically alleyway gleaning? My contention is that the colonial implications of settler urban practices may be a significant object/site of inquiry, especially when those practices are assumed to be counter-hegemonic. What does it mean to situate alleyway gleaning as an alternate or marginal form of circulation, one happening alongside the disposal of waste which constitutes capitalist market value, when alleys are denaturalized and politicized? What does it mean to participate in noncapitalist forms of circulation such as scavenging and gleaning when the giving and taking of these excesses or surpluses is facilitated by an infrastructure that maintains ongoing urbanization of a settler-colonial city?

            <p>
                How might the analytic or "theoretical platform" (Heynen et al. 2006, 8) practiced by urban political ecologists re/orient my approach to urban investigations and the questions that drive my research-creation forwards? How does denaturalizing, historicizing, and politicizing alleyways reorient my practice of urban gleaning? How does it change the way I inhabit/engage the urban everyday?
            </p>

            <p>
                How does gleaning primarily residential alleyways for physical objects differ from other practices of urban scavenging such as food reclamation and redeemable recyclable collection? From the immediacy of walking Vancouver's alleyways, I step/scale back in order to critically consider alleys as infrastructure. What role do alleys play in urban metabolism? What can be gleaned by approaching alleys as sites of continuing circulation that a focus waste/value dialectic of discard under capitalism overlooks by focusing on the contained, exceptional spaces of dumpsters and landfills?
            </p>

            <!-- <p>To what extent are alleyways sites of negotiated belonging where people, plants, animals, graffiti, activities, and discarded matters are rendered in/out of place by complex and situational boundary making practices?</p> -->

                <p>
                    Grounded in the theoretical work of Karen Barad and Erin Manning, I approach crafting as a physical-conceptual practice of thinking with nonhuman others in production of distributed knowledges. To think through creative practice is known as research-creation and outputs traditionally consist of artistic artifacts alongside of the conventional linear monograph. <i>My</i> research-creation outputs, however, posit the two as inextricable by integrating text and multimedia together in websites I craft by hand. While I have previously considered the process of crafting these digital spaces, I have yet to think through the ways in which their form and formation imbricate digital and material craftwork, and the effects this might have on either crafting practice.
                    <br><br>
                    How do physical, digital, and conceptual matters shape one another in craftwork? How might concepts such as tension, slack, hem, and fray come into play in the crafting of digital spaces? Rather than reduce tactility, could the multimodality of handmade websites offer a means to synesthetically feel through the digital?
