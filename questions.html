                        David Hugill calls on geographers to "renovate and extend their interpretations of the 'urban' implications of colonial practice" (2017, 2). Yet, in thinking with what I've learned this term, I'm inclined to refigure his question in order to ask: What are the colonial implications of my urban practices, specifically alleyway gleaning? My contention is that the colonial implications of settler urban practices may be a significant object/site of inquiry, especially when those practices are assumed to be counter-hegemonic. What does it mean to situate alleyway gleaning as an alternate or marginal form of circulation, one happening alongside the disposal of waste which constitutes capitalist market value, when alleys are denaturalized and politicized? What does it mean to participate in noncapitalist forms of circulation such as scavenging and gleaning when the giving and taking of these excesses or surpluses is facilitated by an infrastructure that maintains ongoing urbanization of a settler-colonial city?

                physical-conceptual refigurings?

                What are the possibilities for interfering with the tyranny of top-down orientations without asserting a
                counterhegemony—for "elud[ing] discipline without being outside the field in which it is exercised…" (de
                Certeau 1984, 96)?

                Questions emerging from my studies and practices the <i>second</i> term of my PhD:
            </p>

            <p>
                How might the analytic or "theoretical platform" (Heynen et al. 2006, 8) practiced by urban political
                ecologists re/orient my approach to urban investigations and the questions that drive my
                research-creation forwards? How does denaturalizing, historicizing, and politicizing alleyways reorient
                my practice of urban gleaning? How does it change the way I inhabit/engage the urban everyday?
            </p>

            <p>
                How does gleaning primarily residential alleyways for physical objects differ from other practices of
                urban scavenging such as food reclamation and redeemable recyclable collection? From the immediacy of
                walking Vancouver's alleyways, I step/scale back in order to critically consider alleys as
                infrastructure. What role do alleys play in urban metabolism? What can be gleaned by approaching alleys
                as sites of continuing circulation that a focus waste/value dialectic of discard under capitalism
                overlooks by focusing on the contained, exceptional spaces of dumpsters and landfills?
            </p>

            <!-- <p>To what extent are alleyways sites of negotiated belonging where people, plants, animals, graffiti, activities, and discarded matters are rendered in/out of place by complex and situational boundary making practices?</p> -->

            <p>
                David Hugill calls on geographers to "renovate and extend their interpretations of the 'urban'
                implications of colonial practice" (2017, 2). Yet, in thinking with what I've learned this term, I'm
                inclined to refigure his question in order to ask: What are the colonial implications of my urban
                practices, specifically alleyway gleaning? My contention is that the colonial implications of settler
                urban practices may be a significant object/site of inquiry, especially when those practices are assumed
                to be counter-hegemonic. What does it mean to situate alleyway gleaning as an alternate or marginal form
                of circulation, one happening alongside the disposal of waste which constitutes capitalist market value,
                when alleys are denaturalized and politicized? What does it mean to participate in noncapitalist forms
                of circulation such as scavenging and gleaning when the giving and taking of these excesses or surpluses
                is facilitated by an infrastructure that maintains ongoing urbanization of a settler-colonial city?

                from crafting, 2025
            </p>
            <!-- rgb(247, 42, 66) -->
            <p>
                Grounded in the theoretical work of Karen Barad and Erin Manning, I approach crafting as a
                physical-conceptual practice of thinking with nonhuman others in production of distributed knowledges.
                To think through creative practice is known as research-creation and outputs traditionally consist of
                artistic artifacts alongside of the conventional linear monograph. <i>My</i> research-creation outputs,
                however, posit the two as inextricable by integrating text and multimedia together in websites I craft
                by hand. While I have previously considered the process of crafting these digital spaces, I have yet to
                think through the ways in which their form and formation imbricate digital and material craftwork, and
                the effects this might have on either crafting practice.
                <br><br>
                How do physical, digital, and conceptual matters shape one another in craftwork? How might concepts such
                as tension, slack, hem, and fray come into play in the crafting of digital spaces? Rather than reduce
                tactility, could the multimodality of handmade websites offer a means to synesthetically feel through
                the digital?

                Questions articulated through constructing my comps lists:
            </p>

            <p>
               What of the structural can be seen in the everyday? Or: What is non-phenomenological in the immediate? What of the experiential is inflected, composed, or informed by processes not immediately perceptible? How might perception be tuned to the non-phenomenological and attention sustained in practice to what is not immediately perceptible? This is all to ask: How do I theorize the "urban everyday", and what does it offer in terms of parsing phenomena?

            </p>
            <p>
                What does it mean to generate situated knowledges of (and from within and as part of) the city?
                Refiguring David Hugill's call for geographers to examine the "'urban' implications of colonial
                practice" (2017, 2), what are the colonial implications of my urban practices as a settler in Vancouver?
            </p>
            <p>
               If theory is emplaced, to what extent is theory locally adaptable elsewhere? What's unifying and what's divergent about urban praxis from place to place?
            </p>

            <p>
                Does thinking with and through practices of urban inhabitation open up particular ways of thinking cities? How do everyday navigations shape infra/structural relations, city imaginaries, and the production of urban space?
            </p>

            <p>
                How might we hold together different—incommensurable, even—framings of the city? Which concepts, theories, practices, methodologies, and ethics might aid in this endeavor? 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Why has Google Maps become so widely used? What about the user experience and user interface of other (both proprietary and open source) navigational applications such as Apple Maps and OsmAnd makes them more or less popular to people and companies?
            </p>
            <p>
                In expanding its products through Google Earth Outreach Tools, of which the Google Maps Platform is but a part, what (new) audiences does Google desire to attract and why? For whom is Google Maps useful and for whom is the using of Google Maps valuable? Is there nuance/discrepancy in this regard between the interface and algorithm? What is the commodity at the heart of Google Maps?
            </p>

            <p>
                How are different disciplines and subdisciplines approaching ubiquitous use of navigational platforms such as Google Maps? What kinds of studies are being conducted and how are they structured? What questions are being asked and to what ends? What concerns are foregrounded/backgrounded? Should I do a study, what questions might I ask and why and to whom might I talk? 
            </p>

            <p>
                In what ways does habitual reference to Cartesian configurations of the city influence how urban inhabitants navigate and imagine their cities, and, in turn, cultivate spatial awareness? What, if anything, is significant/consequential about using Google Maps in particular? Are the stakes the same for everyone?

            </p>

            <p>
                How do physical and digital configurations of "the city" become entangled through pedestrian use of navigational applications? To what extent are digital navigational maps mediating users' experience of the city? How might process philosophy's premise of <i>immediation</i> (which bears ontoepistemological similarities to agential realism) trouble dichotomies of the individual/localized/direct and the distributed? What conceptions of scale in relation to bodies and sensory apparatuses are complicated by a "politics of immediation" (Manning 2020)?
