            flows
            interfere with regulated forms of exchange from within the dominant system?
        </p>

        <p>
            How might knowledge generated through everyday spatial practices be rendered without being
            flattened,
            georeferenced, or vectorized? In other words, how might the effect of interferences be marked while
            accounting for the apparatus of their production?

        <p><b>
                Questions articulated in the course of my MA research-creation:
            </b></p>

        <p>
            By whom and of whom are publics made? What are the boundary making practices through which publics are
            constituted as collaborators in the first place?
        </p>
        <p>
            How might one cite interlocutors more than human while accounting for the apparatuses whereby human and
            nonhuman are differentially articulated? How might one cite empirical formations while remaining
            responsive
            to the entangled state of their existence?
        </p>
        <p>
            Do different stories render different cities? Or is it, as so exquisitely suggested by Italo Calvino's
            <i>Invisible Cities</i> (1974), that different framings focus a city differently, evoking a multiplicity
            of
            stories, each one rendering some aspects of a landscape intelligible to the exclusion of others?
        </p>

        <p>
            How are empirics made legible as data by the apparatuses that produce them? How are technoscientific and
            affective orientations to ‘what counts as data’ co-constitutive of an empirical account of the city?

        </p>

        <p>
            I am particularly invested in how the apparatuses through which differential embodiment is constituted
            effect different possibilities for knowing.

        <p><b> Questions emerging from my studies and practices the first term of my PhD:</b></p>
        <p>
            How does research-creation complicate commodities? What might a postcapitalist politics look like that
            doesn't presuppose the boundary between human and nonhuman? How might materiality be repoliticized
            within a
            diverse economy?
        </p>
        <p>
            What happens when gifted materials intermingle with so-called commodities? What would it mean for a
            feminist
            political economy to recognize, as Barad (2007) does, that "Knowing is a distributed practice that
            includes
            the larger material arrangement" (342) "(i.e., the full set of practices) that is a part of the
            phenomenon
            investigated or produced" (390)? How might we account for hauntings materials inherit as they are
            discursively refigured?

        <p>
            What are the possibilities for interfering with the tyranny of top-down orientations without asserting a

        <p><b> Questions emerging from my studies and practices the <i>second</i> term of my PhD:</b></p>

        <p>
            How might the analytic or "theoretical platform" (Heynen et al. 2006, 8) practiced by urban political
            ecologists re/orient my approach to urban investigations and the questions that drive my
            research-creation forwards? How does denaturalizing, historicizing, and politicizing alleyways reorient
            my practice of urban gleaning? How does it change the way I inhabit/engage the urban everyday?
        </p>

        <p>
            How does gleaning primarily residential alleyways for physical objects differ from other practices of
            urban scavenging such as food reclamation and redeemable recyclable collection? From the immediacy of
            walking Vancouver's alleyways, I step/scale back in order to critically consider alleys as
            infrastructure. What role do alleys play in urban metabolism? What can be gleaned by approaching alleys
            as sites of continuing circulation that a focus waste/value dialectic of discard under capitalism
            overlooks by focusing on the contained, exceptional spaces of dumpsters and landfills?
        </p>

        <!-- <p>To what extent are alleyways sites of negotiated belonging where people, plants, animals, graffiti, activities, and discarded matters are rendered in/out of place by complex and situational boundary making practices?</p> -->

        <p>
            David Hugill calls on geographers to "renovate and extend their interpretations of the 'urban'
            implications of colonial practice" (2017, 2). Yet, in thinking with what I've learned this term, I'm
            inclined to refigure his question in order to ask: What are the colonial implications of my urban
            practices, specifically alleyway gleaning? My contention is that the colonial implications of settler
            urban practices may be a significant object/site of inquiry, especially when those practices are assumed
            to be counter-hegemonic. What does it mean to situate alleyway gleaning as an alternate or marginal form
            of circulation, one happening alongside the disposal of waste which constitutes capitalist market value,
            when alleys are denaturalized and politicized? What does it mean to participate in noncapitalist forms
            of circulation such as scavenging and gleaning when the giving and taking of these excesses or surpluses
            is facilitated by an infrastructure that maintains ongoing urbanization of a settler-colonial city?

        <p><b>Questions emerging
                from crafting, 2025</b></p>
   
        <p>
            Grounded in the theoretical work of Karen Barad and Erin Manning, I approach crafting as a
            physical-conceptual practice of thinking with nonhuman others in production of distributed knowledges.
            To think through creative practice is known as research-creation and outputs traditionally consist of
            artistic artifacts alongside of the conventional linear monograph. <i>My</i> research-creation outputs,
            however, posit the two as inextricable by integrating text and multimedia together in websites I craft
            by hand. While I have previously considered the process of crafting these digital spaces, I have yet to
            think through the ways in which their form and formation imbricate digital and material craftwork, and
            the effects this might have on either crafting practice.
            <br><br>
            How do physical, digital, and conceptual matters shape one another in craftwork? How might concepts such
            as tension, slack, hem, and fray come into play in the crafting of digital spaces? Rather than reduce
            tactility, could the multimodality of handmade websites offer a means to synesthetically feel through
            the digital?

        <p><b>Questions articulated through constructing my comps lists:</b></p>

        <p>
            What of the structural can be seen in the everyday? Or: What is non-phenomenological in the immediate? What
            of the experiential is inflected, composed, or informed by processes not immediately perceptible? How might
            perception be tuned to the non-phenomenological and attention sustained in practice to what is not
            immediately perceptible? This is all to ask: How do I theorize the "urban everyday", and what does it offer
            in terms of parsing phenomena?

        </p>
        <p>
            What does it mean to generate situated knowledges of (and from within and as part of) the city?
            Refiguring David Hugill's call for geographers to examine the "'urban' implications of colonial
            practice" (2017, 2), what are the colonial implications of my urban practices as a settler in Vancouver?
        </p>
        <p>
            If theory is emplaced, to what extent is theory locally adaptable elsewhere? What's unifying and what's
            divergent about urban praxis from place to place?
        </p>

        <p>
            Does thinking with and through practices of urban inhabitation open up particular ways of thinking cities?
            How do everyday navigations shape infra/structural relations, city imaginaries, and the production of urban
            space?
        </p>

        <p>
            How might we hold together different—incommensurable, even—framings of the city? Which concepts, theories,
            practices, methodologies, and ethics might aid in this endeavor?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Why has Google Maps become so widely used? What about the user experience and user interface of other (both
            proprietary and open source) navigational applications such as Apple Maps and OsmAnd makes them more or less
            popular to people and companies?
        </p>
        <p>
            In expanding its products through Google Earth Outreach Tools, of which the Google Maps Platform is but a
            part, what (new) audiences does Google desire to attract and why? For whom is Google Maps useful and for
            whom is the using of Google Maps valuable? Is there nuance/discrepancy in this regard between the interface
            and algorithm? What is the commodity at the heart of Google Maps?
        </p>

        <p>
            How are different disciplines and subdisciplines approaching ubiquitous use of navigational platforms such
            as Google Maps? What kinds of studies are being conducted and how are they structured? What questions are
            being asked and to what ends? What concerns are foregrounded/backgrounded? Should I do a study, what
            questions might I ask and why and to whom might I talk?
        </p>

        <p>
            In what ways does habitual reference to Cartesian configurations of the city influence how urban inhabitants
            navigate and imagine their cities, and, in turn, cultivate spatial awareness? What, if anything, is
            significant/consequential about using Google Maps in particular? Are the stakes the same for everyone?

        </p>

        <p>
            How do physical and digital configurations of "the city" become entangled through pedestrian use of
            navigational applications? To what extent are digital navigational maps mediating users' experience of the
            city? How might process philosophy's premise of <i>immediation</i> (which bears ontoepistemological
            similarities to agential realism) trouble dichotomies of the individual/localized/direct and the
            distributed? What conceptions of scale in relation to bodies and sensory apparatuses are complicated by a
            "politics of immediation" (Manning 2020)?
