                            <b>Research Statement</b>
                            <span class="brmedium"></span>
                            My project objective is to interrogate the role of navigational applications—particularly
                            Google Maps—in re/figuring the urban everyday. Situating everyday spatial practices as sites
                            of knowledge production, I call for an active reconfiguration of mental maps through
                            alternate approaches to wayfinding. My proposed project is a research-creation endeavour: I
                            will think via the speculative design and digital construction of a counterhegemonic
                            application for cultivating spatial awareness through destination-disoriented discovery of
                            Vancouver. For an extended articulation of the aims, objectives, significance, and
                            contribution of my project, please see the most recent iteration of my research proposal at
                            <a href="./thinking-through-practice.html" target="_blank">the September 2025 iteration of
                                my research proposal</a> (written for SSHRC application).

                            style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 14px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6;">
                            <b>Overview of Lists</b>
                            <span class="brmedium"></span>
                            In studying how the city comes to matter through everyday spatial practices, I want to
                            foreground tensions between the directness of experience and the broader politics immanent
                            to landscapes of encounter. I turn to the "urban everyday" as a diffractive apparatus for
                            investigating the infra/structural as it articulates in mundane events, encounters, and arts
                            of inhabitation. Taking neither "urban" nor "everyday" for granted, I seek instead to think
                            them through one another towards an understanding of their organization of a scale analytic.

                        </p>

                        <p
                            style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 14px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6;">

                            While List 1 may bear the title, all 3 lists work together to develop a theorization of the
                            "urban everyday". List 1 focuses on theories that configure the city, matters of scale, and
                            approaches to (studying) urban inhabitation. Infrastructure—as political, lived/lively, and
                            affectively inflected—begins here and threads throughout lists 2 and 3. List 2 contends with
                            digital navigational applications not only as platforms but also as infrastructure that
                            increasingly orients everyday spatial practice in many cities. List 3 draws from critical,
                            experimental, and speculative practices of generating, rendering, and interrupting spatial
                            data to suggest mapping as a mode of inquiry itself. Indented readings are readings
                            purposefully paired together because they either elaborate one another, or contrast in a
                            useful way.
                        </p>

                            style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 14px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6;">
                            For each list, I've developed reading questions to think with. These questions build from
                            one list to another; if they serve, I'm always bringing them forward. Employing these
                            questions effectively will be a practice in and of itself as they are not all that easily
                            answered (or definitively answerable). No doubt they will be refigured. An ongoing,
                            open-ended collection of key questions that drive my experimentation forwards (Murris and
                            Bozalek 2019) can be found at: <a href="./questions.html"

                                will ground me in different approaches to urban theory and practice. Sublist 1.1
                                concerns urban theories and how they configure this thing we call the city. I intend for
                                these readings to ground my exploration of cities and urban infrastructure within key
                                debates such as planetary urbanization. Sublist 1.2 attends to the specificities of
                                place in research, and what it means to produce situated urban knowledges—for me a
                                question of researching cities from within and as part of a specific city. Here, I
                                attend also to urban encounter and differential arts of inhabitation. Inhabiting the
                                urban (otherwise) has a reprise in List 3, and more on everyday spatial practices of
                                navigating the city appears in both Lists 2 and 3.&nbsp;</span></p>

                                What of the structural can be seen in the everyday? Or: What is
                                non-phenomenological in the immediate? What of the experiential is inflected,
                                composed, or informed by processes not immediately perceptible? How might
                                perception be tuned to the non-phenomenological and attention sustained in
                                practice to what is not immediately perceptible? This is all to help me think
                                through how I theorize the &quot;urban everyday&quot;, and what it offers in
                                terms of parsing (Baradian) phenomena.

                                the city? Refiguring David Hugill's call for geographers to examine the "'urban'
                                implications of colonial practice" (2017, 2), what are the colonial implications of my
                                urban practices as a settler in Vancouver?

                                If theory is emplaced, to what extent is theory locally adaptable elsewhere? What's
                                unifying and what's divergent about urban praxis from place to place?

                                contends with digital navigational platforms as they increasingly orient urban everyday
                                spatial practices. There exists a plethora of literature on platforms and the city, some
                                written by geographers but much of it generated outside the discipline. I intentionally
                                begin by grounding myself in digital geographies with Sublist 2.1 because I believe a
                                geography and history of the digital offers a strong framework for studying navigational
                                technologies and locative media as they infrastructure urban inhabitation. Sublist 2.2
                                will help me decipher the political economy of navigational platforms. Here, I draw in
                                discussions on platform urbanism and smart city debates, as well as readings on platform
                                economies and digital capitalism. Sublist 2.3 concerns digital navigational
                                applications—particularly Google Maps—in everyday use. In this sublist (and the one
                                prior) I branch out to non-geographers to get a sense of different perspectives on the
                                topic.

                                and open source) navigational applications such as Apple Maps and OsmAnd makes them
                                more or less popular to people and companies?

                                is significant/consequential about using Google Maps in particular? Are the stakes

                                style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">List 3 organizes literature I
                                believe will help think threads from the above lists&mdash;the digital, the urban, the
                                everyday, navigation, inhabitation, and infrastructure&mdash;more critically,
                                experimentally, and speculatively. While the readings in List 3 are clearly influenced
                                by the &quot;ethico-ontoepistemology&quot; (Barad 2007) I bring with me to comps, most
                                of the readings suggested below are intentionally perspectives I have not read before.
                                Sublist 3.1 contends with critical cartography and countermapping in theory and
                                practice, with specific focus on the digital. The digital humanities (DH) finds its way
                                into the conversation here as I will be co-teaching a spatial visualization course at
                                the Digital Humanities Summer Institute next summer, and want to invest time in
                                considering what such an approach to the digital affords mapping, particularly more
                                critical, speculative, and experimental cartography. Fundamental knowledge of DH will
                                also support my proposed design and construction of an alternative digital navigational
                                application. Sublist 3.2 moves beyond maps as representational apparatuses (however
                                emancipatory/participatory, artistic, and counterhegemonic) towards mapping as a mode of
                                immanent, immersive inquiry. Here, I explore the contingent production of spatial data
                                and what non-representational (or perhaps always already more-than representational)
                                mappings and mapping practices might look like. Sublist 3.3 marks a reprise of urban
                                inhabitation first introduced in Sublist 1.2, though this time attending to more
                                localized accounts of engaging the city otherwise. While on the surface much of 3.3
                                might appear to be &quot;walking methods&quot;, I see my work as less concerned with the
                                specificity of particular modes of transportation and more interested in spatial
                                awareness as it is differentially developed through a disorientation-nonadverse approach
                                to wayfinding. I include these texts on &quot;walking the city&quot; more to complicate
                                de Certeau&apos;s largely symbolic critique, and just acquaint myself with literature I
                                often see cited. For my fieldwork and dissertation I will surely read more thoroughly in
                                this &quot;genre&quot;, as in many others.&nbsp;</span></p>

                                style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; line-height: 1.15;">My overall
                                PhD project will
                                once again be a research-creation endeavor. Yet you&apos;ll find maybe one explicit
                                reading on research-creation. This doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m &quot;saving&quot; the
                                research-creation component for later, when I design an artistic artifact or for much
                                later, when I write up my dissertation. It&apos;s already here, in the way I&apos;ve
                                gone about the work of composing my lists. Research-creation is a mode of inquiry, not a
                                method; &quot;Against method!&quot; (Manning 2016, 163). Postqualitative inquiry (which
                                self-identifies as poststructuralist in approach) likewise &quot;refuses
                                methodology&quot; (St. Pierre 2021, 5). Without making a case for such refusal here, I
                                wanted to clarify that List 3, while seemingly more concerned with methods than List 1
                                or 2, is actually about honing a mode of inquiry that can begin to account for what
                                of/in mapping practice remains beyond representation.&nbsp;</span><span

                                coincidence that the questions guiding List 3 are my most longstanding

                                been revised thanks to this year&apos;s readings, courses, projects, practices, and
                                presentations. Maybe my task in this final list is not to answer them so much as rewrite
                                them again.&nbsp;</span></p>

                                vectorizing experiential knowledge? If mapping itself is taken to be a mode of immanent
                                inquiry (Knight 2021), how might theorizations developed through spatial practice be
                                recorded while centering the generativity of cartographic process? How might
                                cartographies include what haunts them yet exceeds representation?

                                to the above lists' composition was the exclusion of lists dedicated to process
                                philosophy, posthumanist performativity, (critiques of) feminist new materialisms,
                                postqualitative inquiry, crip theory, and an extended engagement with research-creation.
                                What I've done is twofold: First, I've begun an open-ended list of the above topics
                                which I'll steadily add to as readings come to my attention. Because these topics, and
                                thinking through practice and posthumanisms/posthumanist performativity in particular,
                                are relevant to my actual project, I will at some point need to read more on them. That
                                moment is just not comps. Second, I include this Haunting list to make space for the
                                ever growing collection of theories, practices, books, and people (and I should expand
                                this to include the nonhuman as well as phenomena, I guess) "I" am moved by and which I
                                continue to think with and through my own research-creation. Intercessors for the
                                outside, these "Friends" (see Manning and Massumi 2014) accompany me without necessarily
                                showing up explicitly in in my exam responses. &nbsp;</span>
