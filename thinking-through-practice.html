      I don't use patterns. I drape around my body and pin and sew. You have to let the dress become what it will. I'm
      inspired by Erin Manning's writing on a Japanese designer in Dress Becomes Body chapter of The minor Gesture,
      though I began hand sewing in this fashion before I encountered this book. (I'll write more on this later)

              Natalie Loveless, <i>How to make art at the end of the world</i>
            </span>

          </p>

          <p>
            The kind of story, or quality of text, I desire to craft in my PhD has been on my mind lately as I prepare
            to assemble my comprehensive reading lists. Orienting toward a topic of study is an ethical matter as it
            involves foregrounding some concerns to the exclusion of others. While my master's research attended to the
            everyday experience of urban inhabitation and thinking with/in posthuman entanglements, my praxis lacked
            recognition of socio-ecological production of cities. Therefore, in my composition of a list entitled Urban
            Everyday, I want to foreground the tension between the directness of experience and engagement with broader
            underlying politics that structure landscapes of encounter. The following renders my exploration and
            response to the question: How might the analytic or "theoretical platform" (Heynen et al. 2006, 8) practiced
            by urban political ecologists re/orient my approach to urban investigations and the questions that drive my
            research-creation forwards?
          </p>

          <p>
            My inquiry takes the form of a diffractive reading in which I read concepts of urbanization as a process
            (Harvey 2014; Brenner 2014), infrastructure as political (Anand 2017; Cowen 2020; Barua 2023), and metabolic
            circulation (Swyngedouw 2006; Newell and Cousins 2014; Zhang 2020) through my practice of alleyway gleaning.
            Drawing from Donna Haraway's (1991) initial suggestion of diffraction as a mapping of <i>the effects</i> of
            difference and Karen Barad's (2007) subsequent ontological elaboration and extension, Karin Murris and
            Vivienne Bozalek (2019) develop propositions to guide diffractive readings: "The idea is to read theory with
            practice diffractively guided by, for example, key questions that move the experiment forward" (pg).
            Diffractive readings agitate presuppositions, allowing new learnings to interfere with prior convictions.
            Reading diffractively challenges the fixity of any one configuration of intelligibility while accounting for
            the differential stakes and constitutive exclusions entailed in each refiguring. Finally, diffractive
            readings are a way to bring different (even incommensurable) perspectives into relation without antagonism.
            Focusing on resonances and dissonances will help me clarify the differences that <i>do</i> matter. I believe
            this sort of exercise serves me well in ascertaining where and how urban political ecology might supplement
            my study.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although my sites of urban gleaning extend beyond alleyways, I impose this enabling constraint (a term from
            process philosopher Erin Manning) so as to practice denaturalizing, historicizing, and politicizing an
            infrastructure my preoccupation with immediacy has heretofore led me to take for granted. Rather than
            conduct an urban political ecology of alleyways which I feel as yet unprepared to do, I aim to map out the
            concerns such an account might foreground and outline the kinds of questions I might ask. For instance,
            before taking urban political ecology this term yet thinking with geographical political economy and J.K.
            Gibson-Graham last term, I would have framed my urban gleaning practices as means of participating in
            noncapitalist economies. However, reading alleyway gleaning through urban political ecology, the question
            arises, What does it mean to situate alley gleaning as an alternate or marginal form of circulation while
            the very infrastructure that conditions it is simultaneously enrolled in the ongoing production of the
            settler-colonial city?
          </p>

          <p>
            I choose to reconceptualize alleyways along the lines of urban political ecology <i>through my practice of
              gleaning</i> because I sense a relational articulation between this particular infrastructure and urban
            metabolisms. Enrolled in economies of resource extraction and development, Vancouver's alleyways literally
            pave the way for municipal waste disposal and in so doing, facilitate the ongoing process of urbanization.
            Walking alleyways while attending to their material histories, uneven maintenances, and the differential
            nature of their ecologies, I believe I can glean more than a dish here or a lemon balm clipping and handful
            of blackberries there. I believe the takeaway will be a more complex view on the politics and ethics of
            thinking <i>with</i> alleyways, <i>through</i> gleaning practices, and <i>in entangled collaboration
              with</i> things gleaned.

          <p>
            The kind of story, or quality of text, I desire to craft in my PhD has been on my mind lately as I begin assembling my comprehensive reading lists. Orienting toward a topic of study is an ethical matter as it involves foregrounding some concerns to the exclusion of others. While my master's research attended to the everyday experience of urban inhabitation and thinking with/in posthuman entanglements, my praxis lacked recognition of the socio-ecological production of cities. Therefore, in my composition of a list entitled <a href="http://negative-spaces.github.io/the-middle-of-things/lists.html" target="_blank">Urban Everyday</a>, I want to foreground the tension between the directness of experience and engagement with broader underlying politics that structure landscapes of encounter. Taking an urban political ecology course this term has given me some critical tools with which to think this through: tracking winners and losers as well as the persistent structures that maintain their disparity; narrating humans and nonhumans as dialectical; exploring contradictions; and making ontological claims while also attending to the epistemes from whence they are made (Robbins 2012, 87). What follows renders the effects of my term project, viz., an exploration and response to the question: <span style="background-color:rgba(246, 248, 170, 0.599)">How might the analytic or "theoretical platform" (Heynen et al. 2006, 8) practiced by urban political ecologists re/orient my approach to urban investigations and the questions that drive my research-creation forwards?</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span style="background-color:rgba(254, 183, 150, 0.27)">My inquiry takes the form of a diffractive reading
              in which I read concepts of urbanization as a process (Harvey 2014; Brenner 2014), infrastructure as
              political (Anand 2017; Cowen 2020; Barua 2023), and metabolic circulation (Swyngedouw 2006; Newell and
              Cousins 2014; Zhang 2020) through my practice of alleyway gleaning.</span> Drawing from Donna Haraway's
            (1991) initial suggestion of diffraction as a mapping of <i>the effects</i> of difference and Karen Barad's
            (2007) subsequent ontological elaboration and extension, Karin Murris and Vivienne Bozalek (2019) develop
            propositions to guide diffractive readings: "The idea is to read theory <i>with</i> practice diffractively
            guided by, for example, key questions that move the experiment forward" (1505, emphasis in original).
            Diffractive readings agitate presuppositions, allowing new learnings to interfere with prior convictions.
            Reading diffractively challenges the fixity of any one configuration of intelligibility while accounting for
            the differential stakes and constitutive exclusions entailed in each refiguring. Finally, diffractive
            readings are a way to bring different (even incommensurable) perspectives into relation without antagonism.
            Focusing on resonances and dissonances will help me clarify the differences that <i>do</i> matter. I believe
            this sort of exercise serves me well in ascertaining where and how urban political ecology might supplement
            my study of the urban everyday.

          <p>
            Gleaning is the practice of gathering materials or information from one's surroundings. Gleaning is a way of making do—a means of poaching from and appropriating the dominant (economic) system from within and as part of it (see <code><a href="https://negative-spaces.github.io/tactics.html" target="_blank">negative-spaces.github.io/tactics.html</a></code> for MA thinking on this). A "surreptitious creativit[y]", gleaning is a kind of tactic which "elude[s] discipline without being out­ side the field in which it is exercised" (de Certeau 1984, 96). Gleaning is taken up in a variety of manners in different contexts (see Agnès Varda's documentary, The Gleaners and I (2000)). I often encounter Vancouver's urban gleaners pushing trolly bags or bikes along the alleyways or up and down Main Street, collecting recyclables from residential and commercial bins, or from municipal garbage bins along the sidewalk that a specific rim for cans and bottles. These gleaners deposit recyclables (along with other discard) for monetary compensation—in other words, it is the exchange value of gleaned items that is operative. Along Fraser Street, informal exchange goes on behind a produce grocer. In one of the little plazas—a section of street cordoned off for gatherings and leisure—along Granville, I pass someone filling their plant pot from a municipal planter that's been torn up in preparation for a spring makeover. My own practice takes me to alleyways, curbsides, corridors, and underpasses where I glean not only physical objects but also graffiti. By turning graffiti into stickers and <a href="https://negative-spaces.github.io/the-middle-of-things/what-the-work-can-do.html#thinking-with" target="_blank">re-siting it around the city</a>, I contribute a "proliferating illegitimacy" (de Certeau 1984, 96). From my job teaching and consulting on mapping at the university library, I gleaned the skills and knowledge to make websites such as this one and my <a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0445244" target="_blank">MA thesis</a>. I appropriate research grants for printing materials as a necessary self-accommodation as much as an interference into dominant economies of knowledge production (see <code><a href="https://negative-spaces.github.io/rendering.html#sitation" target="_blank">negative-spaces.github.io/rendering.html#sitation</a></code> for more on this). Finally, the fabric recycling dumpster in my apartment basement as proved a generative site from whence I've obtained a 2005 pentax digital camera I take most of my pictures on, photo frames to gift my artwork in, a host of clothing I wear, and plain cotton t-shirts I print my artwork on (see <code><a href="https://negative-spaces.github.io/the-middle-of-things/what-the-work-can-do.html#unruly-material" target="_blank">negative-spaces.github.io/the-middle-of-things/what-the-work-can-do.html#unruly-material</a></code> for theory on this).

            <span style="background-color:rgba(254, 183, 150, 0.27)">I choose to reconceptualize alleyways along the lines of urban political ecology <i>through my practice of gleaning</i> because I sense a relational articulation between this particular infrastructure and urban metabolisms. Enrolled in economies of resource extraction and development, Vancouver's alleyways literally pave the way for municipal waste disposal and in so doing, facilitate the ongoing process of urbanization. At the same time and alongside the flow of waste, alleyways facilitate the informal circulation of items set out by those for whom they were no longer useful. Walking alleyways while attending to their material histories, uneven maintenances, and the differential nature of their ecologies, I believe I can glean more than a dish here or a lemon balm clipping and handful of blackberries there. I believe the takeaway will be a more complex view on the politics and ethics of thinking <i>with</i> alleyways, <i>through</i> gleaning practices, and <i>in entangled collaboration with</i> things gleaned.</span>

            <span style="background-color:rgba(254, 183, 150, 0.27)">Although my sites of urban gleaning extend beyond alleyways, I impose this 'enabling constraint' (a term from process philosopher Erin Manning) so as to practice <i>denaturalizing</i>, <i>historicizing</i>, and <i>politicizing</i> an infrastructure my preoccupation with immediacy has heretofore led me to take for granted.</span> Rather than conduct an urban political ecology of Vancouver alleyways (which I feel as yet unprepared to do), I aim to map out the concerns such an account might foreground and outline the kinds of questions I might ask. In short, what's rendered here is my efforts to exercise concepts of urban political ecology learned this term, taking them into my everyday practices in dialogue with infrastructures near and dear to me. I begin what follows by inviting you into my practice. <span style="background-color:rgba(246, 248, 170, 0.599)">How does gleaning primarily residential alleyways for physical objects differ from other practices of urban scavenging such as food reclamation and redeemable recyclable collection?</span> From the immediacy of walking Vancouver's alleyways, I step/scale back in order to critically consider alleys as infrastructure. <span style="background-color:rgba(246, 248, 170, 0.599)">What role do alleys play  in urban metabolism? What can be gleaned by approaching alleys as sites of circulation that the waste/value dialectic of discard studies misses by focusing on the contained spaces of dumpsters and landfills?</span> Positioning alleyways as urban/izing infrastructure, I continue to denaturalize, historicize, and politicize them by situating them "within and as part of"—to borrow a feminist new materialism's phrase, or more specifically a Baradian figure that conveys the ontological inseparability of subject and object, cause and effect, measurement and instruments/agencies of measurement, concept and experimental setup—the settler-colonial city. I conclude by reflecting on notions of the city as process and differences that matter across my own work and perspectives in urban political ecology.

            <span style="font-weight:400;">Walking the alleys</span> is a practice I began after moving to Vancouver in July of 2021. The first neighborhood I lived in was Dunbar, an area predominated by single-family homes on the city's western limit. Both the larger neighborhood of Dunbar-Southlands and the University Endowment Lands it borders to the west occupy unceded Musqueam territory. To the south lies the Musqueam Indian Reserve. Urban Indigeneity—as a historical phenomenon, statistical enumeration, and cultural identity—is something I've just begun learning about. Since the 1950s, the Aboriginal population in Canada's ten largest cities has dramatically increased, from a total of 2,506 in 1951 to 301,095 in 2006 (Peters and Andersen 2013, 37). In Vancouver, Statistics Canada's count for Indigenous identity has gone from 239 in 1951 to 40,310 in 2006 (Peters and Andersen 2013, 37) to 63,340 according to the 2021 census (Government of Canada 2023). From what I've read, this significant leap is due not only to natural increase and net migration but also shifting self-identification as well as changes in who Canada recognized as Indigenous or allowed to claim status (Peters and Andersen 2013, 36). Moreover, Aboriginal urbanization was historically stymied by settler-colonial intent to keep reserves distant from urban areas, "ostensibly to reduce contact between settlers and First Nations peoples but also to ensure that prime land was not under the control of First Nations governments" (Peters and Andersen 2013, 22). First Nations are actors and agents in the urbanization of Vancouver's landscape. For example, near where I live, construction is underway on a massive eleven-tower apartment development on Squamish owned land spearheaded by the Squamish First Nation in partnership with Westbank (Cyca 2024; “Sen̓áḵw,” n.d.).

            My house in Dunbar was fanatic about reusing and recycling. To parry passive aggressive comments about my discard, I began tossing my garbage into neighbors' bins under  cover of night. On a walk with two housemates my first week in Vancouver, we dumpster dove for what I want to say were tortillas or flatbreads of some kind still in their package. Later on, I drove with another housemate to East Point Grey where we snuck into the backyard of a house slated for demolition and stripped a giant plum tree of fruit. The next week the house and all its trees were torn down. In the alleyway between 30th and 31st Ave I found the Epson WorkForce Pro 4740 printer I use every day for both academic and creative projects. The following winter I moved east to Mount Pleasant to a house whose ample backyard opened onto the alley between 12th and 13th. This alley became my main road and lucrative source of dishware, clothing, shoes, sunglasses, and other items set out in cardboard boxes free for the taking. Every other week (and every week for compost aka "organics"), my roommate or I would sort our plastic recycling, glass, paper, garbage, and organics into bins and place them (sanctioned distances apart) for pickup (by whom? which companies). Two years later I moved west again to Fairview. While south of Broadway (9th Ave), Fairview consists of two, three, and four story apartment buildings, a couple towers, and single-family homes, Fairview north of Broadway yet east of Burrard is nearly all condominiums and townhouses. The alleys here are paved, sterile spaces where gleaners only come on garbage pick-up days. Waste is sorted indoors and taken out to the alley (by whom?) only on pick-up days (by what companies?). When there's system failure, pileup occurs as seen in banner image triggering elevator notices to "hold organics" or "hold recyclables".

            To begin material labor on this term project, I spent an entire day walking Vancouver's alleyways. Sidewalks hail pedestrians. In the alley, you're free to move at whatever pace you like and take up as much space as you want. I began in Fairview near Granville Park and zig-zagged my way east to Cambie then back and south into Shaughnessy. Past the massive Oakridge development going up at Oak and 41st, I wandered over to Sunset and over to Victoria-Fraserview. Finally tired, I road the 22 bus down Victoria and Commercial Drive. Stepping of at 4th, I walked west towards Clark Drive, under the skytrain and past Clark Station until I could catch the 84 bus back to Granville. At Brewing August, I continued to read urban political ecology. I intentionally began in a direction I don't often wonder so as to disorient myself. I didn't use Google Maps. Having forgotten to brig water and it being one of the first truly warm days this year, I became quite dehydrated. Thankfully, I wandered through parks with water fountains. An additional problem was lack of public toilets, especially in residential neighborhoods. My "guileful ruse" (de Certeau 1984, 37)? The many unlocked portapotties dotting the alleyways for real estate construction.

         Vancouver's alleys generally run east-west, though they also run north-south along major north-south streets like Granville, Main, Fraser, Clark, Commercial, and Victoria to accommodate commercial businesses. Of course there are exceptions—tangled places where alleys turn onto more alleys. For instance, the area south of Clark Park or around where Victoria and Argyle Drive meet. Across the city, different assemblages cohere in the alleys…. discuss further

            The alleyways of Vancouver are paved with asphalt or, less frequently, compacted gravel. Pavement upkeep varies across the city. To my surprise, the alleys in Shaughnessy (a very wealthy neighborhood) are more often gravel and full of potholes.
          </p>

          <br><br>

            Asphalt is a combination of petroleum and aggregate (graded small rocks/gravel)  (“Asphalt” 2025; “How Is Asphalt Made? A Look Inside the Manufacturing Process” 2024). Aggregate is quarried outside the city's limits in places like Abbotsford by companies like Fraser Valley Aggregate. Interestingly, in 2012, Vancouver began incorporating recyclable plastics into its asphalt in an effort to brand itself "the greenest city" (Ridden 2012). Like waste-to-energy incinerators, incorporating plastics into asphalt is a means of extracting further symbolic and use value from discarded matters. Plastics are recuperated from being waste; embedded in infrastructure, their life as a commodity is extended. Yet what doesn't make headlines is this small detail: the plastic used was not local recycling but rather brought in from Ontario (CBC News 2012). Whose interests are at the heart of this endeavor? Who stands to gain? Is there a way this kind of carbon sequestration can be read as a fix? New avenues for commodification of plastic discard?
          </p>

          <p>
            Alleyways literally pave the way for municipal waste disposal. They facilitate the movement of discarded matters from the container that delimits them as waste—specifically colored and signed dumpsters, bags, and bins—to sorting facilities, the landfill, and waste-to-energy incinerator in Metro Vancouver (see map <a href="https://metrovancouver.org/school-programs/Documents/k-12-system-overview-solid-waste.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>). If I were to conduct an urban political ecology of municipal waste (or discard in general, for that matter,) in Vancouver, I'd follow the flows of waste, as well as the different companies that collect it across the city. There are multiple, for example: "Recycle BC is responsible for residential curbside and multi-family recycling service in the City of Vancouver" ("Vancouver - Recycle BC" 2024), WM provides "residential waste pickup, commercial garbage collection and dumpster rental services" ("Waste, Garbage and Recycling Services in Vancouver, British Columbia | WM," n.d.), and Maple Leaf Disposal picks up residential, commercial, and industrial waste as well as recycling and organics ("Maple Leaf Disposal | Waste Disposal | British Columbia, Canada," n.d.). Municipal waste is not the only discard circulating in the alleyway. Alternate circulation - scavenging of both human gleaners and nonhumans (crows, insects, rats, possums, etc).

            Urban metabolism → upe concept. Tie to municipal waste disposal....

            Municipal waste is not the only discard circulating. Alternate circulation - scavenging of both human gleaners and nonhumans (crows, insects, rats, possums, etc). Bring in FNB book and discard/waste. waste/value dialectic with Gidwani and Reddy. Critique capitalocentrism. Posit alley as site offering frame of circulation missed by containers. so how do different kinds of gleaning operate in urban metabolism?? use/exchange value refiguring. one turns on

            Alleys are infrastructure in that they materially facilitate the movement of discarded matters around and out of the city. Infrastructure as political → upe. different ecologies belonging/s, flakiness, maintenance, aesthetics - only see when falling apart. also Edwards. when did alleyways become a thing in vancouver?

              Deb cowen "What can be gleaned by approaching the city through the infrastructural systems that constitute its materiality"?
