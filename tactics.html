      <div style="line-height:1.5; text-align:justify;">
        The physical composition of body and mind required to read (and metabolize and retain meaning) poses immense
        barriers I've spent the past 4 years finding creative ways to break down. In anticipation of reading for my
        comprehensive exams, I've been honing my practice. What follows is a provisional and open-ended articulation of
        my reading tactics. Take what works and leave what doesn't.
      </div>

      <div style="line-height:1.5; text-align:justify;">
        <b>Use Hard Copies.</b>
        I take notes in the margins as I read. If ideas/connections come up, I'll write them on a post it note which
        I'll either put on my desk/wall, or stick in the book itself. Another way I like to take notes (in class or as I
        read) is on a blank piece of copy paper. This way I can fill the page however I want (I hate lined paper), and I
        can highlight my notes if necessary. I number my pages and staple them together, then fold the notes and slip
        them in the back of the book. Keeping my notes together with my readings is a helpful organizational tactic for
        me. I'll often make a notes page after I read a theory heavy book, where I go back through the book and write
        down different passages or ideas. Sometimes I'll even make a bunch of pieces of paper - organize them by
        different concepts or ideas, and then fill them out as I review the text. Taking notes separately, like on a
        computer, doesn't help me. If I must, I'll print them out and then attach to the reading. I do think that hand
        writing is best for in-the-moment notes. You can always do a writing session later where you summarize the text
        etc. I also carry small journal - blank around with me im always jotting ideas. I don't use a single notebook
        for reading notes though because i read so many different things - like the copy paper because it can be
        associated with the text and only that.
      </div>

      <div style="line-height:1.5; text-align:justify;">
        <b>Mark up texts.</b>
        Marking up texts helps me metabolize information. I'm incredibly particular about my writing utensils because
        the feeling of what I'm handling matters. I use a plain old fashioned pencil or ballpoint pen and two crayola
        crayons, one of them yellow. I'm always loosing things and also like to have writing utensils in all may
        bags/pockets, so this is a low cost way to do that. I love highlighting with crayola crayons because the texture
        is satisfying and the color never fades. I have my own system for underlying, circling, highlighting etc. but
        others likely figure this out themselves. Generally I just highlight important passages that I want to visually
        spot later with yellow, and use the accent color for major points or to emphasize paragraphs. These just act as
        visual cutes to return to etc. and help me feel engaged while reading. my pencil is for note taking in the
        margins. Not fastidious about marking up texts according to all these codes, just want to stay engaged - marking
        up helps me process what im reading.

        <b>Use Flags.</b>
        when books, especially, do second read through after to look at highlights etc, then add flags. show my rundown
        of coding etc.
      </div>

      <div style="line-height:1.5; text-align:justify;">
        <b>Physical organization.</b>
        Figuring out a sustainable way to organize hard copies is important. Folders and standing organizers can work
        well. I have multi-colored plastic shelving units which I took the handles off and labeled with masking tape.
        This way I can take a whole shelf out and it acts like a bin containing papers related to a concept or project.
        Papers I don't use so often or that were related to a class I store out of site. I imagine space limitations
        will be come an issue at some point, as will the number of papers I have printed. But I will deal with that
        issue when it arrises. Having digital copies just doesn't work whatsoever. [pictures] organize and reorganize
        etc.

        <b>Curate a surround</b>
        Different kinds of reading may require different conditions. Reading theory or something I'm - invested -in i
        have to be entirely alone. I think it's because I have to make myself so porous to be open to receiving and
        integrating new information, and I become more sensitive to external stimuli like sounds, smells, temperatures -
        another person around. I like room with few visual distractions - space where i can be for multiple consecutive
        hours. Whatever your ideal reading space is (and it might take trial and error to figure out) curating this
        environment can really help. Before reading, get all the things you might need so you don't have to get up.
        Water, chapstick, writing utensils, clock. Do you need any books to keep you conceptual company. . often out of
        the house xyz. wher i can go for bounded time. curating a surround can also be about the place youpre in. before
        reading, get all the things you might need so you don't have to get up.

        <b>Craft enabling constraints</b>
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbspspecific location - bounded space like VPL north room reserve go till you can read no more,
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbspanother confined space for reading - bus. take 1 paper for 1 bus ride. can be noisy but ive also
        found that having route or something while reading ideas can come up bc you're reading it through the event and
        the timespace.
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsptake only what you can actually read with you. putting too many things in bag with you introduces
        too many options - decision immobilization
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbspset time - pomo for passage of time but also - read for set time like 3 hours or 3 pomos of 35
        minutes. i don't really do the pomo method so much as use the clock to give myself a sense of time.
