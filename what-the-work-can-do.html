    <p>
    begin by situating term, ending of thesis, how i celebrated, what the term felt like. 
    </p>

    <p>>>>>>then, discuss JKGG, diverse economies, lack of materiality discussion, → making practices and thinking with nonhuman intellection others (cite EM and bracha ettinger bit), tabling, what i learned about exchange and transaction, about materiality. how making practices for tabling is research-creation and what that means and does to economies i/it participates (me) in. this is what ill write about in bulk for this iteration. .
    </p> 

    <p>
        end with research questions coming from MA and new ones developed over the course of this term. murris and bozalek  on diffractive reading → reading theory through practice and through those questions that drive your experimentation forwards (your own and others).
