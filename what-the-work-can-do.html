        This is how I feel about my MA research-creation thesis, <code><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.14288/1.0445244" target="_blank"><i>Making space for deep mapping: rendering theory as praxis</i></a></code>. I am perpetually moved by negative-spaces which works in excess of the zip folder submitted to cIRcle. The sense of a work outdoing itself is what I wish to carry forward into my PhD. Without knowing yet what form the staged dissertation will take, I am thinking about what makes any work of mine <i>work</i>—in other words, I am considering "the question of how an artwork evolves to exceed its form, to create from its force-of-form a more-than that can be felt, if not easily described" (Manning 2013, 101). Reading process philosophy alongside J.K. Gibson-Graham and then tabling my artwork this term have urged me to think about how research-creation complicates commodities, interfering with hegemonic discourses of value and evaluation. Research-creation performatively reconfigures boundaries, and those defining the economies in which research and creation operate/participate are no exception. This iteration on an output will reflect on my work over the past term (the first term of my PhD program) and articulate some questions both old and new that continue to drive my experimentation forwards.

        This term I primarily read process philosophy in tandem with class readings for Economic Geography. Although I found the class content rather dull, I did enjoy writing the final paper. It gave me a chance to work through questions lingering in my thesis <code><a href="https://negative-spaces.github.io/tactics.html" target="_blank">tactics.html</a></code> page, which asked: How does my participation (as both academic and urban inhabitant) in unruly material and semiotic flows interfere with regulated forms of exchange from within the dominant system? In emphasizing the ways in which my everyday practices poached capitalism from within, constituting a "proliferating illegitimacy" that "elude[d] discipline without being outside the field in which it is exercised…" (de Certeau 1984, 96), I struggled not to render capitalism omnipotent. Indeed, Trevor wondered whether I hadn't rendered "the economy" a hegemony of its own. I therefore approached my Economic Geography term paper as an opportunity to further explore the perhaps generative interrelation of capitalist and noncapitalist practices, with specific attention to how my research-creation might participate me in diverse economies. To this end, my paper critically assessed the contributions of J.K. Gibson-Graham across three books: <i>The End of Capitalism (As We Knew It)</i> (1996), <i>A Postcapitalist Politics</i> (2006), and <i>Take Back the Economy</i> (2013). (You can see the whole paper <code><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gIFsEV5G_UmRtkco1avWLJyG7mSyLwvQrrMRsRi3d0s/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></code>.) Exercise in faith → trusting that ideas i wanted to think would articulate through the course of writing paper. my job was to make space for them to take shape.

        In sum, while I learned a lot from J.K. Gibson-Graham about capitolocentrism and diverse economies, I didn't find their framework helpful in terms of probing the generative interrelation of capitalism and noncapitalism. The boundaries of different kinds of economic practices were, in my opinion, all too tidy. Two main areas of dissatisfaction emerged for me. First, in constructing and enacting a language of diverse economies, J.K. Gibson-Graham center discourse as both site and instrument for subverting hegemonic fixations of meaning. Discussion of materiality remains wholly unaddressed. Second, the more-than-human and the nonhuman are conspicuously absent across all three books. In a later paper, J.K. Gibson-Graham <i>do</i> consider the "interdependencies,[sic] between humans, environments and non-human entities… displac[ing] humans as the sole agents of ethical decision-making" (Roelvink and J.K. Gibson-Graham 2009, 151). However, their discussion remains focused on the ecological in terms of non-human nature; in thinking "the overdetermined process of production in a commodity economy" (Roelvink and J.K. Gibson-Graham 2009, 152), physical geography and nonhuman species are what comes to matter, not the nonhuman others of equipment and infrastructure. Is not a printer, left in an alleyway constituent of an urban ecology? What might a postcapitalist politics look like that doesn't presuppose the boundary between human and nonhuman? How might materiality be repoliticized within a diverse economy? My exploration of this last question connects back to J.K. Gibson-Graham's insufficient (nonexistent) attention to how materiality influences discourse. Karen Barad, whose posthumanist performativity extends both Butler and Foucault by attending to how matter itself comes to matter, views "materiality as an agentive and productive factor in its own right" (2007, 134). They ask: "Is there any sense in which materiality might be said to constrain discourses? If so, how? Do material reconfiguring have discursive consequences?" (Barad 2007, 225). I find these questions infinitely generative to think with—intercessors, even, for research-creation in its attempt to fruitfully engage with J.K. Gibson-Graham's contribution to feminist political economy.

        Writing my term paper for Economic Geography piqued my interest in what the designation of gifts and commodities does to things, as well as processes of gifting and commodification themselves. "Remember that commodities are just goods and services produced for a market, and that not all commodities are produced in capitalist enterprises" (Gibson-Graham 2006, 68). In <i>The End of Capitalism (As We Knew It)</i>, Gibson-Graham write: "What haunts the capitalist commodity is not only noncommodity production…but noncapitalist commodity production…" (1996, 245). Take household appliances for example. The materiality of a household appliance is rendered differentially intelligible by capitalocentric discourse and the discursive language of diverse economies. Read through capitalism, household appliances are capitalist commodities for consumption; they are goods purchased by families in order to be used for social reproduction, i.e. reproduction of the capitalist workforce through unpaid labor. Read through the framework of diverse economies, however, household appliances come to matter as technologies of noncapitalist commodity production (Gibson-Graham 1996, 31). This reframing, minor though it may seem, challenges the impulse to immediately identify both labor and material by their relation to capitalism. What happens, however, when gifted materials intermingle with so-called commodities? What would it mean for a feminist political economy to recognize, as Barad(s) (2007) does, that "Knowing is a distributed practice that includes the larger material arrangement" (342) "(i.e., the full set of practices) that is a part of the phenomenon investigated or produced" (390)? How might we account for hauntings materials inherit as they are discursively refigured?  
    </p>
    <p>
        One way to think about materiality is by considering how the way things are made participates them in at once material and discursive economies (or physical and conceptual). I offer a speculative reading of what it might mean to account for the hauntings materials inherit as they undergo discursive refigurings. I'll focus on a significant intra-locutor of mine with whom I've been collaborating closely as of late: an Epson WorkForce Pro 4740 printer I gleaned in a Dunbar alleyway soon after I moved to Vancouver. My printer serves two major functions. First, it enables me to print hard-copies of class readings. I require hard-copies to read for many reasons which can most legibly be summarized as "due to disability." Well, most legibly to the reader, not to the institution. Although I am registered with UBC's Center for Accessibility, when I asked to be accommodated with hard-copy readings for class I was told this request was not an accessibility need. My Epson WorkForce Pro 4740 printer has therefore served as a tactic of self-accommodation in the face of UBC's disabling subjectivation. Second, I use my printer to craft cards, stickers, iron-on transfers, prints, bookmarks, zines, and more which I gift freely and barter, as well as exchange at local art markets. The clothing I print on is material I've salvaged for free from the fabric recycling dumpster in the basement of my building, as well as from alleyway free boxes. I also make stickers of graffiti I follow around the city, re-siting these unruly material-semiotics in perpetuation of a "proliferating illegitimacy" (de Certeau 1984, 96).
    </p>
    <p>sitations</p>
    <p>
        In the first case, that of assistive technology, my printer is figured as a <i>commodity</i> in service of knowledge production under (academic) capitalism. In the second case, that of creative practice, my printer may be figured as a <i>means of production</i> for gift and barter economies, as well as for informal markets of alternate and reciprocal exchange. In both cases, I make use of ink and supplies obtained through appropriating institutional grants intended for "fieldwork" and "research materials". In the instance of both assistive technology and creative practice (for the boundary between the two disintegrated over the course of my inquiry), knowledge is distributively produced through the very process (enterprise) of making (laboring) and distributing (transacting) my outputs.
    </p>
    <p>The interference I want to make here is this: drawing from posthumanist performativity, I suggest there is another way to configure appliances, one which gets us out of the capitalism/noncapitalism binary. What if, say, my printer was never wholly interpellated as <i>either</i> a commodity for reproducing capitalism <i>or</i> as a means of noncapititalist commodity production, but was instead s/cited as an intellecting other in its own right. Acknowledged as such, my printer could be recognized as continually gifting its capabilities in exchange for ink and paper. Material outputs are therefore imbricated with mainstream capitalist, alternative capitalist, and noncapitalist economies by virtue of input materials being bought in-store, appropriated from institutional grants, as well as salvaged, poached, and gleaned. Although J.K. Gibson-Graham acknowledge "The market is not all or only capitalist, commodities are not all or only products of capitalism" (1996, 144), discussion of the intertwining nature of capitalist and noncapitalist markets with capitalist and noncapitalist commodities—and noncapitalist noncommodities for that matter—is limited to a single paragraph in <i>A Postcapitalist Politics</i> (2006, 150). Gibson-Graham thus fail to consider things which are produced for market and nonmarket transactions simultaneously. The creative artifacts of research-creation therefore complicate the easy delineation of commodities as goods and services produced for markets. Whether the material outputs of research-creation are figured as gifts (and therefore enrolled in nonmarket transactions) or bartered/traded/sold locally (enrolling them in alternative market transactions) is less important to the project than what the physical-conceptual (or material-discursive, if you prefer) work is <i>doing</i> and how boundaries are being refigured in the process. Therefore, "research-creation participates in both the gift alter-economy and the dominant quantitative economy" (Manning and Massumi 2014, 130). I found the framework of diverse economies ill-equipped to consider this generative interrelation. In finally recognizing that "non-human others and non-labouring others are also implicated in the production and appropriation of <i>surplus</i>", Roelvink and Gibson-Graham (2009) give the example of farmland whose "'gifts'" are repaid in "unremunerated exploitation and degradation" (153, emphasis in original). My reading of so-called assistive technology offers something different, I think, in that my ethics of care is concerned with practices of receiving and acknowledging giftings of things irreducible to commodities. Moreover, simply recognizing my printer as gifting sites its materiality not within commodity capitalism but in the gift economy of alleyways. Operating on urban denizens’ tacit knowledge of the city, matters deemed no longer fit for manufactured purpose are offered up as open-ended invitations for recirculation by passersby. By "urban denizens tacit knowledge of the city" I mean practical knowledge of the way things work; a box of odds and ends put out on the curb or the edge of a lawn means passersby are welcome to take what they want. Though this could be considered a gift economy, it's also entwined with consumer excess under commodity capitalism (once found a giant TV with a note: santa brought a bigger one). Alleyways and free boxes become sites where use and value are refigured. My printer is more than an assistive technology or office appliance—it is an intra-locutor, an intellection other with whom I collaborate in physical-conceptual knowledge production.</p>
    <p>
        Engaging my printer as intra-locutor is a way of making explicit practices of thinking with nonhuman others. I am reminded of Erin Manning's reading of Bracha Ettinger, an Israeli-French artist and psychoanalyst whose Autistwork series works with found images and a scanner. Writes Erin Manning: "the photocopy machine is itself a way of seeing-with, a collaborator in the processual fielding that is the autistwork" (2013, 182). Ettinger's Autistwork series
        <br>
        <span class="quote">
            demonstrates that the <i>how</i> of knowing much exceeds the <i>what</i> (and the who) of knowing…It makes seen the constitutive difference between knowing-with and a more generalized knowing—knowing as categorization, organization, representation. It reminds us that to know is to participate in a folding that will remain an intensity too multiple, too ineffable and too indefinite to articulate without composing-with. To know is to know-with—to participate in the creation of worlds, words churning with the exquisite singular-infinity of eternal objects [conceptualized elsewhere as xyz], seeings-in-the-feeling that continuously reinvent what perception (and knowing) can do.

        <p>A diverse economy is one wherein a multitude of economic practices and relations abound, only some of which are capitalist. While <i>The End of Capitalism (As We Knew It)</i> aimed to situate noncapitalist practices as always already within so-called capitalist economies, the language of diverse economies makes explicit the inherent diversity of transactions, labor relations, and enterprises that make up any one economy. J.K. Gibson-Graham offer the following figure to convey some examples:
        </p>

        <img src="./sitations/readings/a-diverse-economy_JKGG2006-71.jpg" style="width:60%;">
        <p>
            When first asked how my research-creation involved me in the economy, I could only identify myself as a consumer. Gibson-Graham et al. (2013) note that self-identification in terms of capitalism is not at all unusual, since "most people don't see themselves as significant actors in the economy, let alone shapers of it" (xix). Reflecting on a diverse economy, however, I suddenly recognized how my research-creation participates me in not only in dominate regimes of academic knowledge production, but also alternative market transactions including local trading, informal markets, and barter, as well as nonmarket transactions involving household flows, gift giving, institutional appropriations, gleaning, gathering, and poaching. By bringing people's attention to what might otherwise go unregistered as economic activity, J.K. Gibson-Graham begin to shift the economic imaginary towards possibilities otherwise than capitalism. Notice, however, that a diverse economy as they articulate it above does not include mainstream capitalist markets, wage relations, or enterprises. Michael Samers (2005) observes that mundane and small-scale informal employment (by which he specifically means informal paid labor as opposed to informal yet unpaid work) is glossed over by Gibson-Graham who favor more utopic economic alternatives such as cooperatives. What would mainstream markets, mainstream paid labor, and mainstream capitalist enterprises look like? As someone unfamiliar with economics and economic geography, it is difficult (and perhaps hazardous) to conjure up examples. It remains unclear whether mainstream renditions are part of a diverse economy or not. If they are, their elision from the figure of diverse economies seems critical. Can "alternative capitalist" and noncapitalist activities really exist independently of mainstream/hegemonic capitalism? Does decentering capitalism risk missing the generative (and I would argue inextricable) relationality between mainstream capitalism, alternative capitalism, and noncapitalism? Smith and Stenning (2006) raise similar concerns over the limited attention paid in diverse economies literature to the interrelation of capitalist and noncapitalist economies, recognizing "different spheres of economic practices as always already articulated with each other" (193).
