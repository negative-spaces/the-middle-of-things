                <p>A delightful way to enter my comps, this read was recommended by a companion as we walked passed
                    Victoria Park. Since moving to Vancouver in 2021, I've developed meaningful relations with city parks nearby where I've lived. First it was Chaldecott Park and West Memorial Park, where I'd go and read or take a phonecall or meeting and sit in the dugout or beneath the huge trees. When it snowed, my roommate and I tried to sled down the slight slope in West Memorial. Then it was Jonathan Rogers Park. 
                    <!-- the Helen Gutteridge Plaza at City Hall, and the City Hall Park beside it -->
                    Then Granville Park, a sunken park where the fog would collect in winter, where my friend and I would meet halfway between our apartments to catch up. She's moved away now but I still walk there to call her. There are many other parks across the city I frequent less often but are still very dear. Among them, Victoria park for me is a place to paint little canvases with friends in summer, a shady spot to read a book after walking there on a whim, a place to pee and walk in circles while I kill time before an appointment, a manifested encounter, and the destination of the trans march and dyke march (on different years) where I connected with friends and missed connections. Although I know Vancouver is unceded territory and that city parks occupy stolen indigenous land, I hadn't dug deeper into the history or political ecology of the specific parks I use & frequent. I was therefore excited by this recommendation, and figured it would make a good introduction to my comps reading given that I read  around the city (often in parks) and specifically have been attempting to apply the ethic of urban political ecology to my urban practice(s) (see <a href="./thinking-through-practice.html" target="_blank">up my alley</a>).
                </p>

                <p>  
                    Four main chapters, written by four members of a family who's long lived at the
                    corner of Victoria aka Bocce Ball Park, explore the tensions and joys of city parks on
                    occupied land. A photo essay and set of poignant interviews with the longtime park goers are folded between a critical 
                    introduction and overview of "the city park" as a colonial architecture, and an archival tracing of the land title of what is now the City of Vancouver's Victoria Park. 
                    <span class="brmedium"></span>
                    Written by four white settlers who have lived in Vancouver for quite some time, <i>On this patch of grass</i>  approaches parks from four entwined threads (3) which I summarize as <i><b>use</b></i>, <i><b>regulation</b></i>, <i><b>parks as instruments of settler colonialism</b></i>, and <i><b>parks' open-ended nature which affords the possibility of their being remade.</b></i> The book illustrates a serious and head-on working through of what it means to hold dear and meaningful those attachments to "public" lands that not only on stolen but mark the continued cultural, ecological, and territorial dispossession of occupation where park users are unequally policed, both by cops and members of the neighborhood community. "We want to tell part of the park's story here, to interrogate it as a place, a particular kind of urban subjectivity. But more than that, we want to use it as a vehicle for thinking about occupations, the uses of urban parks, the quasi-spiritual claims for the natural world and the history of this city" (9). 
                    
                    </p>

                   <p>
                    Throughout particularly the introduction (Chapter 1) and first (Chapter 2), but also the last chapter (Chapter 5), I appreciated the presence of urban political ecology deployed to denaturalize, historicize, and politicize city parks. "No park is innocent...Parks, urban or not, are exactly as 'natural' as the roads or buildings around them, and they are just as political. Every park in North America is performing modernity and settler colonialism on an everyday basis" (2, see also 39). Tuning in not only to the collaborations and easy multiplication of use in Victoria Park but also the frictions between park users/uses, Matt calls out the biopolitics of park theory as well as (or instantiated by) The City of Vancouver Parks and Recreation, which laud 'diversity' and 'accessibility' and, in the latter's case, reconciliation and Indigenous sovereignty, while determining acceptable uses and quelling more rambunctious users. 

                    <span class="brmedium"></span>
                    "The history of urban parks is one of landscaping and scenery, of utility and improvement, regulation and discipline" he writes, "Parks claim to uplift people...they are the city-but-not-the-city..." (41). When I asked what it means to generate knowledge from within and as part of the city, these spaces of respite are not exempt (this becomes more obvious the moment they turn from uplifting to potentially unsafe milieus as I'm hollered at late at night). In other words, the VPL or the bus or "downtown" are no more "the city" than the scrap of park at the intersection of McLean and Charles where I sat reading this chapter on the "third bench", as two construction workers who called it in their surprise that their were more benches than they had noted on a previous lunch break. 
                     <span class="brmedium"></span>

                    With all its harmonies but especially frictions, Victoria Park, Matt and his family contends, is an exemplary (though not exceptional), lens to address the book's aims: "what I admire so much is the visibility in Bocce Ball Park. The politicization of the park and all its refusals are right there, unmistakable, irreverent. Rather than pacifying the city, this park highlights and amplifies it" (38).
                    </p>

                    In the last chapter, Selena traces the land title's changing hands using archival evidence from the Vancouver Public Library. However, what I found remarkable was how she began the chapter by describing her bikeride home from VPL Central. Including the surrounding visual and affective detail, Selena itinerates her journey along Seymour Street, Dunsmuir, the Viaduct, Keefer Street, Keefer Place, Keefer Ave, Main Street, Hastings, Keefer again, Campbell,  across Hastings, then onto Powell Street, Across Clark Drive, on to Odlum Drive, then up Grant Street, across Commercial Drive, and finally to  the southwest corner of Bocce Ball Park where she dismounts at home. I can vividly imagine her route from downtown to east van. On the next page, we learn she's taken this route intentionally so as to ride along the streets named after the figures whose hand in the urbanization of Vancouver and the titling of Victoria Park she's about to elaborate. She denaturalizes the names naming streets which too easily become "the background to our daily lives and are repeated in such everyday and mundane ways that they have little meaning attached to them anymore — other than as a way to mark an address" (115).

                    <i><b>Reflections on Reading Questions</b></i>
                    <br>
                    As a whole, I think this book directly attends to my question <i>What of the structural can be seen in the everyday?</i> in terms of taking an everyday site composed of/by everyday activities and denaturalizes, historicizes, and politicizes it to reveal how "that one square block articulates so many of the aporias of occupied urban land" (6). The authors take two simultaneously abstract and immensely, necessarily, concrete things—decolonization and city parks—and tackle their relation. 
                    <span class="brmedium"></span>
                    I'm still thinking this last analysis through but:
                    The everyday reappears throughout the book. Of course, "We encounter parks in everyday and bodily senses" (2), but I picked up a on there being a larger sense 'the everyday' was both an affordance—how parks could be made through low-intensity refiguring of relations—and an obscurance to the very ordinary, micropolitical (relating to affect, not small as Barua reiterates) ways in which (racial and) colonial logics may work under the radar for white settlers in a settler-colonial city. Parks are places where the  "everyday work of biopolitics" plays out (29). Yet also, "everyday activities give us clues as to how we can share land in a decolonial sense" (5). 
                    <span class="brmedium"></span>
                    Maybe the better question is after what else, or what <i>more</i> exists in the everyday. Asking questions like <i>What of the experiential is inflected, composed, or informed by processes not immediately perceptible?</i> keeps these tensions in mind so as to not take Vancouver parks, for instance, for granted as a universal public good or accessible commons (33-34). It's a way to, like I asked, 
                    <i>tune perception to the non-phenomenological and sustain attention in practice</i> (or in <i>use</i>) <i>to what is not immediately perceptible</i> for me <i>but which composes parks as urban assemblages</i>. 
                    <span class="brmedium"></span>
                    I'm reminded of a paper "Can political ecology be decolonised? A dialogue with Paul Robbins" read last year for class. I believe the conclusion was no, not unless it's land back, but that doesn't mean you can't work in ways that are anti-colonial. But with <i>On This Patch of Grass</i>, it feels more like a maybe—they are saying yes, what if city parks were offered back to the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations (44). While I (and I imagine they) don't have the power to offer Bocce Ball Park to the Nations whose land it is in a land-title sense, taking up urban political ecology as an ethic (rather than analytic) is a way to think seriously through settler-colonial architecture and the anti-colonial possibilities for remaking parks, even toward a decolonial future. And, to think these reworkings <i>in practice</i> - like Selena on her bikeride - refiguring relations in and through everyday activities (5) where before these tensions and potentialities may have gone unrecognized/unconsidered. Thus, this book also responded to my question <i>What are the colonial implications of my urban practices as a settler in Vancouver?</i>
