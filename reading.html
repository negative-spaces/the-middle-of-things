                <p>A delightful way to enter my comps, this read was recommended by a companion as we walked past
                    Victoria Park. Since moving to Vancouver in 2021, I've developed meaningful relations with city parks nearby where I've lived. First it was Chaldecott Park and West Memorial Park, where I'd go and read or take a phonecall or meeting and sit in the dugout or beneath the huge trees. When it snowed, my roommate and I tried to sled down the slight slope in West Memorial. Then it was Jonathan Rogers Park where the swing chains are super long and you can see the mountains if you swing high enough. 
                    <!-- the Helen Gutteridge Plaza at City Hall, and the City Hall Park beside it -->
                    Then Granville Park, a sunken park where the fog collects in winter, and where my friend and I would meet halfway between our apartments to catch up. She's moved away now but I still walk there to call her. There are many other parks across the city I frequent less often but are still very dear. Among them, Victoria park for me is a place to paint little canvases with friends in summer, a shady spot to read a book after walking there on a whim, a place to use the bathroom and walk in circles while I kill time before an appointment, a manifested encounter, and the destination of the trans march and dyke march (on different years) where I connected with friends and missed connections. Although I know Vancouver is unceded territory and that city parks occupy stolen indigenous lands, I hadn't dug deeper into the history or political ecology of the specific parks I use & frequent. I was therefore excited by this recommendation, and figured it would make a good introduction to my comps reading given that I read  around the city (often in parks) and specifically have been attempting to read urban political ecology as an ethic through my urban practice(s) (see <a href="./thinking-through-practice.html" target="_blank">up my alley</a>).
                </p>

                <p>  
                    Four main chapters, written by four members of a family who's long lived at the
                    corner of Victoria aka Bocce Ball Park, explore the tensions and joys of city parks on
                    occupied land. A photo essay and set of poignant interviews with longtime park goers are folded between a critical 
                    introduction and overview of "the city park" as a colonial architecture, and an archival tracing of the land title of what is now the City of Vancouver's Victoria Park. 
                    <span class="brmedium"></span>
                    Written by four white settlers who have lived in Vancouver for quite some time, <i>On This Patch of Grass</i>  approaches parks from four entwined threads (3) which I summarize as <i><b>use</b></i>, <i><b>regulation</b></i>, <i><b>parks as instruments of settler colonialism</b></i>, and <i><b>parks' open-ended nature which affords the possibility of their being remade.</b></i> The book illustrates a serious and head-on working through of what it means to hold dear and meaningful those attachments to "public" lands that not only are stolen but mark settler occupation's continued cultural, ecological, and territorial dispossession. Park users are unequally policed, both by cops and members of the neighborhood community. "We want to tell part of the park's story here, to interrogate it as a place, a particular kind of urban subjectivity. But more than that, we want to use it as a vehicle for thinking about occupations, the uses of urban parks, the quasi-spiritual claims for the natural world and the history of this city" (9). 
                    
                    </p>

                   <p>
                    Throughout particularly the introduction (Chapter 1) and first chapter on city parks (Chapter 2), but also the last chapter on land titling (Chapter 5), I appreciated the presence of urban political ecology deployed to denaturalize, historicize, and politicize city parks. "No park is innocent...Parks, urban or not, are exactly as 'natural' as the roads or buildings around them, and they are just as political. Every park in North America is performing modernity and settler colonialism on an everyday basis" (2, see also 39). Tuning in not only to the collaborations and easy multiplication of use in Victoria Park but also the frictions between park users/uses, husband and father Matt Hern calls out the biopolitics of park theory as well as (or instantiated by) The City of Vancouver Parks and Recreation Board, which laud 'diversity' and 'accessibility' and, in the latter's case, reconciliation and Indigenous sovereignty, while determining acceptable uses (for instance, stalling a collaborate non-Indigenous and Squamish dance in Stanely Park due to settler-bureaucrats misunderstanding Indigenous protocols (32)) and quelling more rambunctious users. 

                    <span class="brmedium"></span>
                    "The history of urban parks is one of landscaping and scenery, of utility and improvement, regulation and discipline" Mat Hern writes, "Parks claim to uplift people...they are the city-but-not-the-city..." (41). When I asked what it means to generate knowledge from within and as part of the city, these spaces of respite are not exempt (this becomes more obvious the moment they turn from uplifting to potentially unsafe milieus as I'm hollered at late at night). In other words, the VPL or the bus or "downtown" are no more "the city" than the scrap of park at the intersection of McLean and Charles where I sat reading this chapter on the "third bench", as two construction workers called it in their surprise that their were more benches than they had noted on a previous lunch break. 
                     <span class="brmedium"></span>

                    With all its harmonies but its especially frictions, Victoria Park, Matt, Selena, Sadie and Daisy contend, is an exemplary (though not exceptional), lens to address the book's aims: "what I admire so much is the visibility in Bocce Ball Park. The politicization of the park and all its refusals are right there, unmistakable, irreverent. Rather than pacifying the city, this park highlights and amplifies it" (38).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    In the last chapter, wife and mother Selena Couture traces the land title's changing hands using archival evidence from the Vancouver Public Library (VPL). What I found most remarkable was how she began the chapter by describing her bikeride home from VPL Central. Including the surrounding visual and affective detail, Selena itinerates her journey along Seymour Street, Dunsmuir, the Viaduct, Keefer Street, Keefer Place, Keefer Ave, Main Street, Hastings, Keefer again, Campbell,  across Hastings, then onto Powell Street, across Clark Drive, on to Odlum, then up Grant Street, across Commercial Drive, and finally to the southwest corner of Bocce Ball Park where she dismounts at home. I can vividly imagine her route from downtown to east van. On the next page, we learn she's taken this route intentionally so as to ride along the streets named after the figures whose hand in the urbanization of Vancouver and the titling of Victoria Park she's about to elaborate. In beginning her chapter like this, she denaturalizes the names which too easily become, for settlers at least, "the background to our daily lives and are repeated in such everyday and mundane ways that they have little meaning attached to them anymore — other than as a way to mark an address" (115). To me, that's the start of generating a situated knowledge that thinks <i>with</i> place.
                   
                </p>
     
                <p>
                    As a whole, I think this book directly attends to my question <i>What of the structural can be seen in the everyday?</i> in terms of taking an everyday site, composed of/by everyday activities, and denaturalizing, historicizing, and politicizing it to reveal how "that one square block articulates so many of the aporias [paradoxes or contradictions, points of uncertainty] of occupied urban land" (6). The authors take two simultaneously abstract and immensely, <i>necessarily</i>, concrete things — decolonization and city parks — and tackle their relation. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm still thinking this last analysis through but:
                    The everyday reappears consistently throughout <i>On This Patch of Grass</i>. Of course, "We encounter parks in everyday and bodily senses" (2), but I picked up a on there being a larger sense in which 'the everyday' was both an affordance — how parks could be made through low-intensity refiguring of relations — and an obscurance to the very ordinary, micropolitical (not small, but rather relating to affect, as Barua clarifies), ways in which racial and colonial logics may work under the radar for white settlers in Vancouver. Parks are places where the  "everyday work of biopolitics" plays out (29). Yet also, "everyday activities give us clues as to how we can share land in a decolonial sense" (5). 
                    <span class="brmedium"></span>
                    Maybe a better question is after what else, or what <i>more</i>, can be seen/read in the everyday. Asking questions like <i>What of the experiential is inflected, composed, or informed by processes not immediately perceptible?</i> keeps these tensions in mind so as to not take city parks, for instance, for granted as a universal public good or accessible commons (33-34). It's a way to, like my creading question, 
                    <i>tune perception to the non-phenomenological and sustain attention in practice</i> (or in <i>use</i>) <i>to what is not immediately perceptible</i> for me <i>but which composes parks as urban assemblages</i>. 
                    <span class="brmedium"></span>
                    I'm reminded of the paper "Can political ecology be decolonised? A dialogue with Paul Robbins" read last year for class. I believe the conclusion was no, not unless it's land back, but that doesn't mean you can't work in ways that are anti-colonial. While not about the community of practice that is political ecology, <i>On This Patch of Grass</i> seems to be using the tools of political ecology — tracking winners and losers as well as the persistent structures that maintain their disparity; narrating humans and nonhumans as dialectical; exploring contradictions; and making ontological claims while also attending to the epistemes from whence they are made (Robbins 2012, 87) - to possibilize decolonizing city parks: what if city parks were offered back to the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations (44). While offering the land-title of Bocce Ball Park to the Nations whose land it is is not in my nor the Hern-Couture family's legal power, taking up urban political ecology as an ethic (rather than analytic) is a way to think seriously through settler-colonial architecture and the anti-colonial possibilities for remaking parks toward a decolonial future. And, to think these reworkings <i>in practice</i> - like Selena on her bikeride - refiguring relations in and through everyday activities (5) where before these tensions and potentialities may have gone unrecognized/un(der)considered. Thus, this book also responded to my question <i>What are the colonial implications of my urban practices as a settler in Vancouver?</i>

                        <i>Seeing Like A City</i> extolled the primacy/importance of infrastructure, arguing for the necessity of attention to and investment in urban infrastructure as a commons meant to benefit all.
                        <span class="brmedium"></span>
                        Amin and Thrift variously frame the city as a "machine" (), "as a sum of assemblages" (22), and "an infrastructural entanglement with considerable formative agency" (). They refer to "citiness" as "the combined vitality and political economy of urban sociotechnical systems, which we believe define the modern city" (3), where the sociotechnical systems considered are <b>1.</b> urban metabolic systems, <b>2.</b> mutual access choreographed by the navigation systems and infrastructure, and <b>3.</b> human identity and affect as influenced by the (vital) urban landscape (4). "We want to see the city from the inside out" (4), they claim, and narrate citiness from the ground up. However, while the reader is assured "city never becomes City" (60), I found the book to rather imply city = City. I wished specific cities were explored, or attention payed to what specificity gives us and what it does not. 
                       </p>
       
                       <p>
                        Opening with the core argument that "the infrastructure of the modern city can become the main focus of political action" (6), they conclude with a politics of infrastructure. 
                        "Modern" here and above initiates a division carried throughout the book between "modern cities" and the "developing world". (More on this in my summary of <i>Ordinary Cities</i> and <i>Postcolonial Theory</i> further down.)
                        A politics of infrastructure, they argue, requires <b>1.</b> visibilizing repair and maintenance work (recollecting artist Mierle Laderman Ukeles who Luke told me about) (84); <b>2.</b> redesigning institutions which are no longer fit for purpose; <b>3.</b> making intercessors for infrastructure (87); <b>4.</b> changing infrastructures from tramlines to something that offers a sense of possibility (89); <b>5.</b> a new vision of the world where all things form a constituency (90); and <b>6.</b> injecting these into the interactions of everyday life.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Though their drawing from assemblage theory and some ATP gives space for the city to be more than the sum of its flows and infrastructure, again and again I got the sense that infrastructure, as ultimately the target of an exigent policy redesign, was something concrete, mediating the urban experience of space (51). "Infrastructure is a structure of contact that also defines what shows up as real at any juncture... It is the gross material of materiality" (). Additionally, though infrastructure is political as well as procedural (89), there were moments where I thought an urban political ecology analytic was in contrast—for example, the "natural sound" (52) of birds and such was contrasted to the mechanical noises of the urban milieu, and cities rendered as an "artificial environment" (43).

                    <p>
                        Planetary urbanization, mentioned once only and on the first page, is implicitly eschewed in favor of a more relational approach. Though not in the index, they appear to espouse the "urban age" thesis, indeed beginning their book "with an audit of the world significance of cities" (11). 
                        <br>
                        <span style="padding-left:30px;"> I actually read the Martinez et al. (2021) paper “Productive Tensions? The ‘City’ across Geographies of Planetary Urbanization and the Urban Age” midway through writing this reflection, as it was really unclear to me how Amin and Thrift were approaching cities. I do believe it's more in an urban age vein, though the way they think about dynamicity even as they forward a policy agenda might portend the melding of the two. </span>
                        <span class="brmedium"></span>
                        However, Amin and Thrift <i>do</i> emphasize the extensive and intensive nature of urban infrastructure, framing the history of anthropocene as a history of urbanization (1) and dedicating an entire chapter to how "cities are one of the main products and producers of the Anthropocene" (34). 
                    </p>


                    <p> 
                        I actually noticed that multiple turns of phrase or conceptual framings articulated in <i>Seeing Like A City</i> (2017) which were taken up and extended by <i>Lively Cities</i>' "minor ecology of infrastructure": the focal shift from matter to materials (82), the idea of "meshwork" (116-119) and the idea of a lively city. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, while Amin and Thrift clearly enjoyed writing this book and the illustrations were beautiful, theoretically, it fell short for me. I thought the way they used their citations held them back. For example, in discussing how cities think through eliciting and parsing feedback, they are quick to clarify that cities do not think in the same way as people. More so, they demonstrate the "noncorrelational thought" of, you guessed it, autistics. Then, and I kid you not, two sentences later they literally cite Erin Manning's <i>Always More Than One</i>—a lesser hyped but in my opinion beautifully sparse in comparison to later books, account of the more-than, choreography, and autistic perception. But how do they use it? To mark the multiplicity of "'scales and registers of life, both organic and inorganic' (Manning, 2013, p. 226), that resonate together in all manner of dispositional ways" (82-83). It just felt like they were not moved by their references the way Barua was, and used the most special and inspired works instrumentally. I don't know how you read <I>Always More Than One</I> and <i>that's</i> the standout sentence.

                        In this chapter, Gordillo draws on anecdotal experience of Las Lajitas' infrastructural and agricultural transformation from 2003 onwards (though its change was initiated by processes beginning in the 1980s and 90s) to elaborate the concept of "the metropolis". Over a period of 20+ years, Las Lajitas, Argentina, transformed from a rural town to hub of soybean processing involving both local/national and international corporations, stakeholders, and interests. Its transformation, Gordillo emphasizes, "did not involve the growth of a self-referential, bounded object. On the contrary, those assemblages of roads, machinery, vehicles, and silos were all designed to facilitate the transportation of soybeans and their industrialized derivatives to densely populated urban centers across the world" (68-69). The chapter then lays out how the rapid and intensive urbanization/industrialization/infrastructuralization in places far and disconnected from cities, places like Las Lajitas, is better understood not as the extension of a single city but rather as the part of the metropolis at work.

                        The metropolis is "not an extended version of 'the city'" (69) - an urban agglomeration or "conurbation" as repeatedly described in <i>Seeing Like A City</i> - but rather the assemblage of metabolic infrastructure (and more) through which an urban agglomeration reproduces itself and expands. While the metropolis cannot be grasped simply from a god's eye remove, the "planetary scale" is not entirely eschewed. Gordillo's chapter at once critiques and extends planetary urbanization, parsing totality from totalization: "the totality posed by planetary urbanization is crucial for thinking holistically about the Anthropocene" (73). A "nontotalizing totality" (76), the metropolis is presented as "a heuristic, <i>concrete</i> abstraction to name the materiality of the continuum that moves matter from one continent to another in order to reproduce and expand the metabolism of the largest urban agglomerations on Earth" (69, emphasis in original). Gordillo's attention to nuance and what a framework of planetary urbanization can offer

                        resonates with the argument made by Martinez et al. (2021) to bring planetary urbanization into dialogue with the urban age thesis. However, while Martinez at al. (2021) suggested the city itself as a heuristic, Gordillo resists re-posing the essentialized city form.

                        In using the term Anthropocene, however, Gordillo is not centering/exceptionalizing human activity so much as describing the reality of there being no outside to climate and landscape change. He goes on to describe the "Metropolis as...infrastructure of the Anthropocene" (93) in that the metro-bolic infrastructure (my shorthand) described above is unevenly intensive, marking some "areas of the planet with a high density of infrastructures created to" feed the voracious metropolis (83). These high density areas Gordillo calls "zones of imperial extraction" (83). Not only are capitalism's free trade and neoliberal deregulation and privatizations "legal-territorial technologies" for creating and maintaining these zones, more and more, infrastructures and logistics are too (83). Thus, the metropolis is an imperial constellation (83).

                    <p>
                        This approach to infrastructure is markedly different from Amin and Thrift's in <i>Seeing Like A City</i>. Methodological cityism aside, in claiming "cities are one of the main products and producers of the Anthropocene" (Amin and Thrift 2017, 34), Amin and Thrift missed attending to the imperial nature of cities' (and the extensive and intensive infrastructure that exceeds their bounds yet reproduces them) toll on the environment goes unaddressed. However, there <i>are</i> were a couple potential points of resonance, or at least one: the commons. Though Amin and Thrift position infrastructure itself as "the essential urban economic commons", they do call for policy to recast it from a means of private profit to that of the equitable distribution of public services. This includes the design as well. Gordillo, on the other hand, assumes a commonplace understanding of what the commons is, and, through examples of local and state resistance to "legal-territorial technologies" (essentially Monsanto tried to stop and frisk trucks for patented seed as they left silos in Rosario but unlike surrounding countries, seeds cannot be made private property in Argentina), illustrates the metropolis as "a generative space of collective encounters that offers the potential to reinvent the commons" (71).

                        I found this chapter excellent to think through a reframing I wouldn't have otherwise encountered. For instance, Barua, while also critiquing planetary urbanization though for other reasons, defaults to using "the metropolis" as stand in for an extended city. Reflecting on this reading I think I'll re/read scale critique(s) for the Anthropocene next.

                <p>
                    More than halfway through reading <i>Lively Cities</i>, I went without the book for a day and read
                    this article on "Racial Feralization" because I thought it could elaborate the figure of ferality
                    also employed used by Barua, as well as bring it into discussions of race and the deployment of racial logics to govern populations in terms more specific to the human. Though not an animal geographer myself, I have so much added appreciation and respect for Barua's insistence on the importance of attending to other than human lifeworlds in the city when I return
                    to literature discussing similar figures but devoid of the nuance present in accounts that feature
                    the more-than-human as at minimum present, active agents in co-constituting the urban fabric. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this paper, Valayden suggests contemporary governance strategies wield/leverage potential risk of disaster, whose increased frequency and intensity results from planetary urbanization, as legitimation to deploy racial logics to order cities. "Racial feralization is racial governance in the age of planetary urbanization" (11). Unquestioningly taking planetary urbanization as the current state of affairs, he "argue[s] that racial feralization, as a <i>conception</i> of race, has reappeared as a problematic of government in the context of a risk-society..." (Valayden 2016, 3, emphasis in original). Furthermore, the stakes of the risk are existential. 
                    <span class="brmedium"></span>
                    Valayden, along with "the majority of race scholars", contends that "the critique of race must take place through a critique of philosophical humanism"  (2). Closely reading Foucault, he points to a pitfall of many interpretations that take 'Western episteme' "as an empirical reality" (2) rather than an analytic to understand how 'Man' is cohered and maintained (3).  Valayden suggests "racial feralization" as a parallel discourse to modernity/coloniality, one which "refers to the ever present potential that humanity will slip back into and blend with nature" (3). 
                    <span class="brmedium"></span>
                    <span class="block-quote">"racial feralization is the future posited by the discourse of government where a catastrophic engulfment threatens the human form, and where decomposition and decay will reduce the planet to a volatile landscape of random violence. Racial ferality inaugurates a form of governance at the threshold of the future survival of the human race" (14)</span>
                    <span class="brmedium"></span>
                    Racial feralization thus provides a counternarrative to the dominant discourse which assumes infinite progress and the one-day obsolescence of 'Man' (rather than seeing the overrepresentation of the former mentality tied to the impossibility of the latter (2)). Taken as "an analytic and not an empirical fact" (18), racial feralization is a way to understand how racial logics persist in (biopolitics operating on) fears of loosing the human/'Man' - and, therefore reveals philosophical humanism as never all that "self-assured" (3). 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    To note another particularly vivid passage:
                    <span class="brmedium"></span>
                    <span class="block-quote"> 
                    "Racial feralization represents the threat that the human will be engulfed by nature, and that human life will be reduced to formlessness and random violence, devoid of any ability to create meaning in the world. That is, the symbolics of race, so central to modernity's self-understanding, would be undone by the impossibility of symbolization...racial feralization has been revived as a problematic of government ot extend the matrix of race ot populations surplused by neoliberal capitalism. Racial ferality acts as a principle of legitimation to govern the perceived exponential increase of catastrophic dangers in a risk society whose context is planetary urbanization" (18) 
                </span>
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                 Valayden's unquestioning deployment of planetary urbanization as the organizer of our current world to me read ironically similarly to taking "Western episteme" as empirical fact. He also doesn't seem interested in delving into the construction of "disaster" or "natural disasters" for that matter. There was no specific populations described even though an array of examples come to mind. And, of course, no mention of how the "matrix of race" has been extended to nonhuman populations "surplused by neoliberal capitalism" (18) and those <i>already</i> in beastly positions. 
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                 Racial feralization is repeatedly posed as a "problematic of government", but I would have liked further elaboration of the "problematic" at hand. Indeed, I felt the same language was used repetitively to re-state the original claim. I was left confused as to how racial feralization was at once a "threat" and "analytic" - to me it seemed like Valayden was deploying it in one way, and governments were deploying it an other. Moreover, and maybe it's because I don't have a background knowledge of critical race scholarship, but it seemed "race" as a constructed category and "human race" as species slipped into one another. <br><span style="padding-left:20px; display:block">(The feared dissolution of the human race as a species, not necessarily through dying out but through loosing coherence as an ontological category, reminded me of Simone's description of what he meant by "from extinction to abolition". Unfortunately and strangely Valayden, to my recollection, didn't so much attend to the nuance in extinction, not only as proffered by other scholarship but in the difference, within his own argument, between the dissolution of the human as a category distinct from nature and the dying out of the human species, conceivably similar or identical though those two feared fates may be. Again, this reiterates an absence of attention to those <i>already</i> in beastly positions.)</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                 In <i>Lively Cities</i>, Barua explicitly attends to how racial logics been extended to nonhuman populations through anticipatory fears of the stranger. In chapters 3 & 4 of <i>Lively Cities</i>, where ferality features most prominent, Barua takes his analytic developed in the context of (trans-species Macaques ethologies in) Delhi to another <i>postcolonial</i> city, London, where he uses the figure of ferality to explore (and this, like any attempt to summarize this book, is an oversimplification) how the movement of more-than-humans in and out of the frame of lively capital and affective relations across species divides offers another way to meaningfully understand the material politics and practices of urban inhabitation and urbanization itself.</p> 

                 <p>
                    True to his mode of argumentation throughout the book, Barua articulates the feral in both major and
                    minor terms. (Major ≈ canon, arborescence, human-centered, god's eye, top-down, etc.) Major connotations of the feral include breakdown, imageries/realities of predation by the rich, and apprehension of forms that exist as neither domesticated nor wild—those once
                    domesticated that escaped and now live in-between,likened to loose animals or criminals ranging the
                    otherwise ordered/orderly city. However, "as a theoretical category constituting the outside to
                    capital, ferality becomes a productive entry point for a minor articulation of cities composed
                    <!-- through flows". (replace with quote) ( Importantly, Barua - critiques flows - hylomorphic, but shows, actually, reproduction - fleshyness of flows etc - something devoid in Valayden's framing of a "capitalism...defined by flows and the infrastructure that secures the circulation of goods" (14).)  -->
                     <i>It is the major figure of ferality that Valayden pursues. </i>

                 <p>In the chapters on ferality, Barua is particularly interested in feral Parakeets—those that escaped or were released and which now proliferate London. Parakeets began being brought to Britain from South Asia and West Africa in the early 1900s as part of the exotic bird trade, though the current feral population of 8,600 breeding pairs (106) stem from escapes around 1969 (109). Feral parakeets have created an urban niche for themselves that, contra invasion biology and biotic nativism stoked sentiments, there is no evidence is negatively impacting "native" species. Actually, some species have changed their habits in relation to Parakeets. Though London's verdant and gregarious population of feral parakeets draws mixed sentiments from individuals, many enjoy feeding the birds, both at home at a bird feeder or outside. The affective relations Parakeets have developed with humans contribute to their infrastructural niche. Other contributors to their proliferation and thriving include the staggered bloom-times of urban flora, also introduced via imperial importation. Over generations, Parakeet's genetic and behavioral changes in relation to London's urban environment and flora and fauna mark a novel form of evolution and index Barua compellingly calls "recombinant urbanisms".

            In Valayden's account, racism morphs, no longer legitimated through establishing people in hierarchies but forstalling catastrophe (12); "The symbolics of race - the categories that define fixity - are allowed to decompose through individualization and hybridization up to the point where this degeneration signals the threat of racial feralization" (Valayden 12)

                <p>
                 Barua would therefore agree with Valayden on the bioplitical deployment of racial logics:

                     "Feralization enters discourse and practice as a problematic of government and allows various agencies to identify, name and govern a population in racial terms.

                though Barua would likely not agree with Valayden that planetary urbanization is responsible. Indeed, in the next chapters which I read after finishing this paper, Barua makes the case for viewing the pastoral as immanent to cities, and the urban question being just as much an agrarian one.

                        I read this in order to clarify my reading response for <i>Seeing Like A City</i> (2017), as it seems Amin and Thrift eschew planetary urbanization for a more relational approach, but then cite the urban age. So, my question is, are planetary urbanization and the urban age the same thesis? 
                        <!-- I have not yet read intensively on planetary urbanization (which I will just as soon as I finish my reading summaries from <i>On This Patch of Grass</i> to "Racial Feralizations"), but from my understanding  -->
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       To answer: definitely not! The urban age thesis emerged in 2007 half the global population were deemed to be living in areas defined as urbanized. While urban age discourses collapse the urban and the city by emphasizing the latter as a political and economic driver, planetary urbanization (as I knew already) de-centers "the city" as a discreet and bounded place, shifting focus instead to the "relentless modification of the socio-spatial conditions of the planet under late capitalism" (1013). Planetary urbanization recognizes urbanization processes as multiscalar and extensive, enrolling areas not discreetly urban. Thus, "By transcending the urban/rural dualism - a key assumption underlying the partitioning of urban and rural areas that sustains the urban age thesis - capital accumulation, state regulation, common resources privatization, or socio-environmental degradation are conceptualized as constitutive processes of the planetary urban condition, rather than socio-spatial qualities ascribed to specific types of settlements" (1016). Attention to areas outside city limits enrolled in processes of urbanization is required lest we fall into methodological cityism. Whereas the urban age framing persists in multilateral policy practice, planetary urbanization is increasingly a commonplace framework in academic theorizing.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Citing limited exchange between the two theses, this paper seeks to bring them into conversation. Planetary urbanization's transcendence of dualisms, the authors argue, risks missing local practices when the city is approached as a political community. Finally, they suggest two pathways for "more-than-academic intervention" through "critical and strategic deployment of the city as a concept" (1018) or "heuristic" (1017). First, 
                        <br>
                        <span class="block-quote">
                            "recognition of significant work that has been done to insert the experiences of Southern cities into global policy agendas, and the possibilities that this holds for further critical diversification of what is understood by 'urban' challenges in those agendas. Deeper appreciation of the diverse forms, trajectories and capacities of cities in the majority world (among academics as well as multilateral agency actors) is an important corrective in its own right to inherited, normative conceptions of 'the city' based on historical experiences in the North...Southern urbanism could infuse global urban policy with more critical accounts of contemporary urban conditions, including those associated with planetary urbanization."
                        </span>
                        And second, "foreground[ing] human dimensions of various geographies of urban transformation" (1019), re-valuing the city as a site of local political communities where the right to the city is, at a policy level, disentangled from the city-centric logics of provisioning markets and privatizing public assets (2017). 
                        This work, of "disentangl[ing] the legitimation of specific urban normative imaginaries within the very discursive space that has engendered them", the authors suggest are "scholarly efforts" (1017). Does this reiterate an academic-policy divide, where the latter taking up theories of the former will 'get it wrong' without scholarly intervention?  
                        <span class="brmedium"></span>
                        Anyway, probably written more than enough for this paper but it did absolutely answer my question and is a good point of reference. I'll likely understand more once I've read & metabolized the planetary urbanization readings for my comps. </p>

                        The first scale critique is one I was recommended a year or more ago, and have returned to a couple times since, most memorably in the third week of a geographical political economy course taken last fall after reading Eric Sheppard's (2002) "The Spaces and Times of Globalization: Place, Scale, Networks, and Positionality", Nagar et al.'s (2002) "Locating Globalization: Feminist (Re)readings of the Subjects and Spaces of Globalization", then Niel Brenner's (2001) "The limits to scale? Methodological reflections on scalar structuration" followed by Sallie Marston and Neil Smith's (2001) response. This paper has stuck in my mind as, while not directly referenced in my reflection then, instigated a curiosity at how "geographical scale" was taken to mean something self evident. 
                            <span><span class="block-quote" style="height:200px; overflow:scroll; background-color:rgba(208, 244, 244, 0.243)">
                                I read Sheppard (2002) and Nagar et al. (2002) to be discussions of positionality at different scales. While both Sheppard (2002) and Nagar et al. (2002) espouse positionality, Sheppard's is at the scale of 'territory' or 'territorial unit' whereas Nagar et al. focus on the scale of the body, household, and community. Sheppard (2002) believes that place, scale, and networks aren't enough to make sense of globalization in a moment when digital technologies are refiguring space by shrinking contact times. Drawing from feminist theory, Sheppard (2002) argues "connectivity across space/time requires attention to… positionality" (315). He uses "<i>positionality</i> to describe how different entities are positioned with respect to one another in space/time" (318, emphasis in original). Borrowing from physics, he suggests the 'wormhole' as a way of describing relationships between territories with similar positionalities. The wormhole transcends Euclidean space, folding space/time based not on proximity—a measure of physical distance—but on the "intensity and nature of interconnectedness…" (Sheppard 2002, 324). In contrast, what feminist analysis brings to economic globalization literature is the call to theorize from from below—that is, starting from the perspective of marginalized people and economic spheres (Nagar et al. 2002, 263). Nagar et al. (2002) go on to evince the often contradictory experiences women have as subjects of globalization. Across both papers, I found scale to be just too tidily constructed and delimited. Thinking with the readings from Week 2, I wonder whether 'body' and 'household' can so easily be scaled as bounded entities? The asymmetric porosity of home and work call into question the territorial unit of a household as being a discreet scale: when a wife brings <i>her</i> "'work'" to her husband's office, it is "hardly an invasion"; yet, when a husband brings <i>his</i> work home, he invades the household with the "sphere of paid work" (Massey 1995, 494). When is a body localizable as an individual actor and when does it interpellate a (domestic; professional) sphere? Both Sheppard's (2002, 318) definition of positionality and the contradictions playing out in everyday experiences suggest positionality has everything to do with scale. Indeed, I'd argue positionality is a scalar relation. 
                                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                                Though I was heartened in my expectation that Brenner (2001) would more explicitly account for the construction of scale, his blunt jab at Marston (2000) and subsequent provocations served only to intensify my feeling that something was missing. Brenner (2001) does three things. First, he critiques Marston's (2000) article on the social construction of scale in which she focuses on the geographical unit of the household to analyze the role of social reproduction and consumption on capitalism's scalar structuring. Brenner (2001) argues that other lexicons such as those of 'territory', 'locale' and 'place' would be better suited to describe the household, and that scalar concepts should be saved for discussions of relations and embeddedness. Second, Brenner (2001) differentiates between what he sees as <i>singular</i> and <i>plural</i> interpretations of the 'politics of scale'. The <i>singular</i> understanding, which he ascribes to Marston's (2000) study, focuses on a "self-enclosed geographical <i>unit</i>" where "scale is understood essentially as a boundary separating the unit in question — be it a place, a locality, a territory or any other spatial form — from other geographical units or locations" (599, emphasis in original). A <i>plural</i> 'politics of scale', by contrast, is concerned not only with the "production of differentiated spatial units as such, but…their embeddedness and positionalities in relation….The referent here is thus the <i>process</i> of scaling…geographical scale is understood primarily as a modality of <i>hierarchization</i> and <i>rehierarchization</i> through which processes of sociospatial differentiation unfold both materially and discursively" (600, emphasis in original). Brenner (2001) advocates for this plural understanding of the 'politics of scale' as he believes it appropriately captures the "determinate…positions [of geographic scales] as differentiated units within multitiered sociospatial hierarchies…" (600). Third and lastly, Brenner (2001) contributes eleven propositions for investigating 'scalar structuration', defined as a dimension of sociospatial processes that become vertically hierarchized into "distinct spatial units" (604). 
                                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                                What I found lacking across all papers (but especially Brenner (2001)) was  attention to the presupposition of a singular <i>scale analytic</i>, facilitated in part by the collapse in meaning of 'scale' and 'unit'. <i>Scale analytics</i> is my provisional attempt at identifying the framework of intelligibility which relationally configures "distinct spatial units" (Brenner 2001, 604). <i>Scale analytics</i> orient so-called scale-units in scalar relation. For example, the following is the scale analytic of Google Maps which calls graphical elements (units) into relation by a framework of proportional distance: <img src="./sitations/ggle-maps-scale.png" style="width:20%">. I can rescale this scale by treating it as an image. In doing so, I impose an entirely different scale analytic, one of height and width measured in pixels. What of scale-units enrolled in multiple scale analytics at once? Brenner's fifth proposition edges towards to what I have in mind but defaults again to scales of positionality: "Each geographical scale is constituted through its historically evolving positionality within a larger relational grid of…sociospatial processes, relations and interdependencies. Consequently, the very intelligibility of each scalar articulation of a social process hinges crucially on its embeddedness within dense webs of relation to other scales and spaces" (606). I suggest a positionality of scales, nay, <i>a positionality of scale analytics</i>. This would allow for a multiplicity of scale analytics to exist simultaneously while remaining reflexively responsive to the politics of choosing one to frame intelligibility. A <i>positionality of scale analytics</i>.accounts for positionality both of relations between scale-units and how the relations themselves are an effect of the scale analytic which configures them. In this way, scale-units such as 'body' or 'household' are provisionally configured as "scalar articulation[s]" (Brenner 2001, 606) or "articulated moments in networks of social relations and understanding" (Massey in Sheppard 2002, 312).  
                                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                                In <i>Pollution is Colonialism</i>, Max Liboiron (2021) writes: "Scale is about what relationships matter within a particular context." Thinking with a scale analytic as a relational configuration—one of many possible frameworks of intelligibility which renders connections determinate in just such a way—I ask in response to Brenner's propositions for investigating scalar structuration through a plural politics of scale: Is naming "context" as that which relationally matters a scaling practice? If yes, might the "context of the context" then become a positionality of scale analytics?

                            </span>
                        The reason I suggest "urban everyday" as a scale analytic is because of this thinking. As I write in my <a href="./lists.html" target="_blank">List Overview</a>, I turn to the "urban everyday" as a diffractive apparatus for investigating the infra/structural as it articulates in mundane events, encounters, and arts of inhabitation. Taking neither "urban" nor "everyday" for granted, I seek instead to think them through one another towards an understanding of their organization of a scale analytic.

                        Derek Woods' main argument is that the human "species" is not the subject of the Anthropocene. This kind of scaling up of human agency belies how patternings of relationality cohere differently at different scales, or zoom levels. This phenomenon, which occurs with abundance across every discipline, he calls "scale variance." Scale variance describes how "the observation and operation of systems are subject to different constraints at different scales due to real discontinuities" (133). It follows that "The scale-critical subject of the Anthropocene is not 'our species' but the sum of terraforming assemblages composed of humans, nonhuman species, and 'technics'" (134).

                        The opposite of scale variance is the smooth zoom effect (134) where "Scale is assimilated to measure" (135). By this latter statment, Woods is refering to when the scale itself is a unit of measurement (133). For example and like I described in my response above, when a literal scalebar that dictates measurement is taken to be continuously scalable. Moving "behond measure"  "scale critique emphasizes disjunctures and incommensurable differences among scales. Scale variance refers to the thresholds that constrain biophysical, technological, and social becoming, thresholds beyond which scale effects influence how we observe systems and how they work" (135).

                       My main discontent with this first paper is that while Woods uses an animation of zooming in on the world by powers of ten while the human, panoptic vioce-over remains a constant scale. This might seem too technical but if you consider the "planetary digital zooming" enabled by ubiquitious interactive webmaps/interfaces like Google Earth where the human viewer does remain positioned at the same scale, staring at the screen, until more recently, such webmaps are full of disjuncture. By this I mean that the tile layers that underly them are sets of static images at discreet zoom levels which load as you zoom. If you play the below video, you can watch the tiles load around the periphery.
